## Gather Zoho People credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Zoho People. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with access to the developer console in Zoho People must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Look up your account domain

Look up your Zoho account URL and make a note of the domain. 

* For US: https://accounts.zoho.com

* For EU: https://accounts.zoho.eu

* For IN: https://accounts.zoho.in

* For CN: https://accounts.zoho.com.cn

* For AU: https://accounts.zoho.com.au

* For JP: https://accounts.zoho.jp

### Generate a new client

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Zoho Developer console, click **Get Started**. 

</Step>
<Step>
On the **Self client** tile, click **Create Now**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the client a name, such as "ConductorOne". 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create** then click **OK**. A client ID and client secret are generated and shown on the **Client Secret** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the client ID and client secret. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Generate an authorization code 

<Steps>
<Step>
Next, click **Generate Code** and enter the scope `ZOHOPEOPLE.forms.READ`. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the time duration and enter a description, then click **Create**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the authorization code. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Get a refresh token

<Steps>
<Step>
Finally, run the following cURL command to generate a refresh token. Replace the placeholders with the values you've looked up: 

```bash
curl --location 'https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=<CLIENT ID>' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=<CLIENT SECRET>' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
--data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=https://www.zoho.com' \
--data-urlencode 'code=<AUTHORIZATION CODE>'
```
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the refresh token. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Zoho People connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Zoho People credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Zoho People** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Zoho People connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the client ID and secret in the **Client ID** and **Client secret** fields. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the refresh token in the **Refresh token** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Use the **Account domain** dropdown to select your Zoho account domain. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Zoho People connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Zoho People](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-zoho-people) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the Zoho People connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Zoho People connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 
</Step>
</Steps>
  
Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Zoho People connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-zoho-people-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-zoho-people-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Zoho People credentials
  BATON_ZOHO_CLIENT_ID: <Zoho People client ID>
  BATON_ZOHO_SECRET_ID: <Zoho People client secret>
  BATON_ZOHO_CODE: <Zoho People refresh token>
  BATON_DOMAIN_ACCOUNT: <Domain for your Zoho People account (one of US, EU, AU, IN, CN, JP). Default is US.>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-zoho-people.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-zoho-people
  labels:
    app: baton-zoho-people
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-zoho-people
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-zoho-people
        baton: true
        baton-app: zoho-people
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-zoho-people
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-zoho-people:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-zoho-people
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-zoho-people-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Zoho People connector to. Zoho People data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Zoho People connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
