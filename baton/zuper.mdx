The Zuper connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

When a new account is created by ConductorOne, the account's password will be sent to a [vault](/product/admin/vaults). 

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Zuper.

## Gather Zuper credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Zuper. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

### Generate an API key

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Log into Zuper Pro.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Navigate to **Settings** > **Account Settings** > **API Keys**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **New API Key**. 
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter a name for your key, such as "ConductorOne", and click **Generate**. 
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Carefully copy and save the API key. 
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Look up your API URL

Make the following HTTP call to the Zuper Pro API to look up your Base API URL: 

  ```bash
  curl 'https://accounts.zuperpro.com/api/config' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \
  --data-raw '{"company_name":"your-company-login-name"}' \
  --compressed
  ```

The call's response will look like this: 

  ```json
  {
      "type": "success",
      "config": {
          "dc_name": "us-west-1c",
          "dc_provider": "AWS",
          "dc_country": "US WEST",
          "dc_api_url": "https://us-west-1c.zuperpro.com",
          "dc_socket_url": "https://us-west-1c.zuperpro.com:8443",
      }
  }
  ```

The `dc_api_url` in the response is your Zuper account's BASE API URL. 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Zuper connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Zuper credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Zuper** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Zuper connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the Base API URL in the **API URL** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the API key in the **API key** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Zuper connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Zuper](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-zuper) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Resources

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-zuper): Access the source code, report issues, or contribute to the project.

### Step 1: Configure the Zuper connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Zuper connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Zuper connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-zuper-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-zuper-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Zuper credentials
  BATON_API_URL: <Zuper Base API URL>
  BATON_API_KEY: <Zuper API key>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-zuper.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-zuper
  labels:
    app: baton-zuper
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-zuper
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-zuper
        baton: true
        baton-app: zuper
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-zuper
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-zuper:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-zuper
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-zuper-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 

</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Zuper connector to. Zuper data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Zuper connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
