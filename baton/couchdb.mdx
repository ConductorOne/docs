<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.

## Gather CouchDB credentials

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in CouchDB. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Steps>
  <Step>
  The username and password for your CouchDB account, or for a service account you've set up.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The URL, including port number, of your CouchDB tenant (for example: `https://couchdb.example.com:5984`).
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the CouchDB connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of CouchDB credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **CouchDB** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new CouchDB connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Enter the URL, including port number, of your CouchDB tenant in the **CouchDB URL** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Enter the username and password of a CouchDB account in the **Username** and **Password** fields.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your CouchDB connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [CouchDB](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-couchdb) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the CouchDB connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new CouchDB connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

  Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your CouchDB connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-couchdb-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-couchdb-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # CouchDB credentials
  BATON_USERNAME: <CouchDB account username>
  BATON_PASSWORD: <CouchDB account password>
  BATON_INSTANCE_URL: <URL, including port, of the CouchDB instance>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-couchdb.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-couchdb
  labels:
    app: baton-couchdb
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-couchdb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-couchdb
        baton: true
        baton-app: couchdb
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-couchdb
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-couchdb:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-couchdb
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-couchdb-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the CouchDB connector to. CouchDB data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your CouchDB connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
