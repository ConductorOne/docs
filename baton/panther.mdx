## Gather Panther credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Panther. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the permission to make API tokens in Panther must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a Panther API token

<Steps>
<Step>
In Panther, click the gear icon in the top menu bar and select **API Tokens**.
</Step>
<Step>

Make a note of the **API URL** shown at the top of the page. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create New Token**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the API token a name, such as "ConductorOne".
</Step>
<Step>

Give the token the following permissions:

   - In the **User Management** section of the page, select **Read User Info**
   - In the **Configuration** section of the page, select **Read Panther Settings Info**
   - In the **Supplementary** section of the page, select **Read API Token Info**
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create API Token**. The token is shown on a new page.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the token. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Panther connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Panther credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Panther** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Panther connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **API key** and **API URL** fields, enter the credentials you created in Panther.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Panther connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Panther](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-panther) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Panther connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Panther connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>	
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Panther connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-panther-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-panther-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Panther credentials
  BATON_TOKEN: <Panther API token>
  BATON_URL: <API URL of your Panther account>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-panther.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-panther
  labels:
    app: baton-panther
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-panther
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-panther
        baton: true
        baton-app: panther
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-panther
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-panther:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-panther
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-panther-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Panther connector to. Panther data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Panther connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
