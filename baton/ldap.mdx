The LDAP connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). 

## Gather LDAP credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials for LDAP. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

Here's the set of credentials you'll need when setting up the connector:  

- The username and password of an LDAP account
- URL of the LDAP server, which can use either `ldap:` or `ldaps:` schemes, and optionally includes a port number

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.  

## Configure the LDAP connector 

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of LDAP credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

*Cloud-hosted connector not currently available.*
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [LDAP](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-ldap) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.** 

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new LDAP connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new LDAP connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your LDAP connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-ldap-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-ldap-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # LDAP credentials
  BATON_BIND_DN: <Username to bind to the LDAP server with>
  BATON_PASSWORD: <Password to bind to the LDAP server with>
  BATON_URL: <URL to the LDAP server, optionally including port number>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-ldap.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-ldap
  labels:
    app: baton-ldap
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-ldap
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-ldap
        baton: true
        baton-app: ldap
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-ldap
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-ldap:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-ldap-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the LDAP connector to. LDAP data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your LDAP connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
