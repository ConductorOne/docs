\*The connector can optionally sync role permissions.

## Gather Auth0 credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Auth0. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
**Important**

A user with the ability to create a new application in Auth0 must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create an Auth0 application

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In Auth0, navigate to **Dashboard** > **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create Application**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Give the new application a name, such as "ConductorOne".
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Select the **Machine to Machine Applications** option and click **Create**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Select the management API for your domain.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Give the application's access token permissions:

	**You'll need these permissions to give ConductorOne **READ** access (syncing access data):**
	- read:users
	- read:grants
	- read:organizations
	- read:organization\_members
	- read:roles
	- read:role\_members
	- read:resource\_servers (required only if you configure the connector to sync role permissions)

	**You'll need these permissions to give ConductorOne **READ/WRITE** access (syncing access data and provisioning access):**
	- read:users
	- read:grants
	- read:organizations
	- read:organization\_members
	- read:roles
	- read:role\_members
	- update:users
	- create:role\_members
	- create:organization\_members
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Authorize**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    On the **Application Settings** page, click **Settings**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Carefully copy and save the Client ID and Client Secret for the application.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Auth0 connector

<Warning>
**To complete this task, you'll need:**

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Auth0 credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Auth0** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Auth0 connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Base URL** field, enter the base URL for your Auth0 instance in `https://companyname.auth0.com` format.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields, enter the credentials.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    **Optional.** If you want the connector to sync role permissions, enable **Sync permissions**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Auth0 connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Auth0](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-auth0) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Auth0 connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Auth0 connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.
	Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Auth0 connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-auth0-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-auth0-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Auth0 credentials
  BATON_AUTH0_BASE_URL: <Base URL of the Auth0 instance>
  BATON_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID: <Auth0 app client ID>
  BATON_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET: <Auth0 app client secret>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: include if you want to sync role permissions 
  BATON_SYNC_PERMISSIONS: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-auth0.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-auth0
  labels:
    app: baton-auth0
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-auth0
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-auth0
        baton: true
        baton-app: auth0
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-auth0
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-auth0:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-auth0
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-auth0-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Auth0 connector to. Auth0 data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Auth0 connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
