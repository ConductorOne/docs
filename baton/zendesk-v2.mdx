The Zendesk connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

 ## Gather Zendesk credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Zendesk. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with **System Admin** access and the permission to create and delete users in Zendesk must perform this task.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
In your Zendesk account, navigate to the **Admin** page by clicking the gear icon in the left menu bar.
</Step>
<Step>
Locate your Zendesk subdomain in the top right corner of the page.

</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Zendesk connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Zendesk credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Zendesk v2** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Zendesk connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Subdomain** field, enter the subdomain.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Email** field, enter the email address associated with your System Admin account in Zendesk.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the token into the **API Token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** Enter a comma-separated list of the organizations you want to sync in the **Organizations** field. If this field is left blank ConductorOne will sync all available organizations. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Zendesk connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Zendesk](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-zendesk) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Zendesk connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Zendesk connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps> 
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Zendesk connector deployment:
#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-zendesk-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-zendesk-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Zendesk credentials
  BATON_API_TOKEN: <Zendesk API token>
  BATON_EMAIL: <Email address associated with your System Admin account in Zendesk>
  BATON_SUBDOMAIN: <Zendesk subdomain>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-zendesk.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-zendesk
  labels:
    app: baton-zendesk
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-zendesk
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-zendesk
        baton: true
        baton-app: zendesk
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-zendesk
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-zendesk:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-zendesk
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-zendesk-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Zendesk connector to. Zendesk data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Zendesk connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
