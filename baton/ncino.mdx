<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Gather nCino credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in nCino. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Company Admin** role in nCino must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate 

<Steps>
<Step>
Make sure the nCino Mortgage API is enabled on your account.
</Step>
<Step>
In nCino, navigate to **Company Settings** > **API Management**.
</Step>
<Step>
If relevant, select **nCino Mortgage** from the dropdown of APIs.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Credentials** tab, click **Add credential**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the credential a name, then click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the client ID and client secret for your new credential.
</Step>
<Step>
Next, authorize the credential to access the necessary endpoints. Find the newly created credential in the list on the **Credentials** tab and click the three-dot menu, then select **View details**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enable **GET** on the API endpoints that display info on team members, loan officers, and loans. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the nCino connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of nCino credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **nCino** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new nCino connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the nCino credentials into the relevant fields.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your nCino connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the nCino connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Resources 

[Contact ConductorOne's support team](mailto:support@conductorone.com) to download the latest version of the connector.

### Step 1: Set up a new nCino connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new nCino connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your nCino connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-ncino-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-ncino-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # nCino credentials
  BATON_NCINO_BASE_URL: <nCino API base URL>
  BATON_NCINO_CLIENT_ID: <nCino API client ID>
  BATON_NCINO_CLIENT_SECRET: <nCino API client secret>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-ncino.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-ncino
  labels:
    app: baton-ncino
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-ncino
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-ncino
        baton: true
        baton-app: ncino
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-ncino
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-ncino:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-ncino
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-ncino-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the nCino connector to. nCino data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your nCino connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
