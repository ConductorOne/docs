## Gather Opsgenie credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Opsgenie. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
**Important**

A user with the **Owner** or **Admin** role (or a custom user role with the **Edit Configuration** user right) in Opsgenie must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate a new API key

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Log into Opsgenie and navigate to **Profile settings** > **API key management**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Add new API key**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Give the API key a name, such as **ConductorOne**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Give the API key **Read** and **Configuration access** access rights.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Add API key**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The new API key is generated for you. Carefully copy and save the API key.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Opsgenie connector

<Warning>
**To complete this task, you'll need:**

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Opsgenie credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Opsgenie** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Opsgenie connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Opsgenie connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Opsgenie connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Opsgenie connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Opsgenie connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.
	Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Opsgenie connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-opsgenie-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-opsgenie-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Opsgenie credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <Opsgenie API key>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-opsgenie.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-opsgenie
  labels:
    app: baton-opsgenie
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-opsgenie
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-opsgenie
        baton: true
        baton-app: opsgenie
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-opsgenie
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-opsgenie:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-opsgenie
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-opsgenie-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Opsgenie connector to. Opsgenie data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Opsgenie connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
