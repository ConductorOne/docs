[This connector can sync secrets](/product/admin/inventory) and display them on the **Inventory** page. 

## Gather Oracle Cloud Infrastructure credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure user with the ability to create API keys plus the following permissions (through direct assignment or group membership) must perform this task:

- Allow group `<GROUP>` to inspect users in tenancy
- Allow group `<GROUP>` to inspect groups in tenancy
- Allow group `<GROUP>` to inspect user-group-memberships in tenancy
- Allow group `<GROUP>` to inspect policies in tenancy
</Warning>

### Look up your OCI tenant's OCID 

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console, navigate to **Governance & Administration** > **Organization Management** > **Tenancies**.
</Step>
<Step>
Copy and save the tenancy OCID.
</Step>
</Steps>  

### Look up your user OCID 

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console, navigate to **Identity** > **My profile**.
</Step>
<Step>
Copy and save the user OCID.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Look up your region

Make a note of your region, such as `us-sanjose-1`. 

### Generate an API key pair 

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console, navigate to **Identity** > **My profile** > **Tokens and keys** > **API keys**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add API key** then select **Generate API key pair**.
</Step>
<Step>
Download the public and private key files that are generated for you.
</Step>
</Steps>   

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Oracle Cloud Infrastructure connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the **Tenancy OCID**, **User OCID**, **Region**, and **Fingerprint** into the relevant fields.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Choose file** and upload the **Private key**.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** Enable **Sync secrets** to display them on the [Inventory page](/product/admin/inventory).
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-oracle-cloud-infrastructure) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Oracle Cloud Infrastructure connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Oracle Cloud Infrastructure connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Oracle Cloud Infrastructure credentials
  BATON_TENANCY_OCID: <Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenant OCID>
  BATON_USER_OCID: <Oracle Cloud Infrastructure user OCID>
  BATON_REGION: <Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region (such as "us-sanjose-1")>
  BATON_FINGERPRINT: <Oracle Cloud Infrastructure public key fingerprint>
  BATON_PRIVATE_KEY: <Oracle Cloud Infrastructure private key, in PEM format>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to sync secrets
  BATON_SYNC_SECRETS: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-oracle-cloud-infrastructure.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-oracle-cloud-infrastructure
  labels:
    app: baton-oracle-cloud-infrastructure
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-oracle-cloud-infrastructure
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-oracle-cloud-infrastructure
        baton: true
        baton-app: oracle-cloud-infrastructure
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-oracle-cloud-infrastructure
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-oracle-cloud-infrastructure:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-oracle-cloud-infrastructure
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure connector to. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
