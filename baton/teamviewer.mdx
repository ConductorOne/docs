## Capabilities

| Resource     | Sync | Provision |
| :------------ | :---- | :--------- |
| Accounts     | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>   | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>        |

The TeamViewer connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

*You must opt into group syncing when configuring the TeamViewer connector. 

### Connector actions

Connector actions are custom capabilities that extend ConductorOne automations with app-specific operations. You can use connector actions in the [Perform connector action](/docs/product/admin/automations-steps-reference#perform-connector-action) automation step.

**Available actions:**

| Action name | Additional fields | Description |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| enable_user | `user_id` (string, required) | Enables a disabled TeamViewer user account |
| disable_user     | `user_id` (string, required) | Disables an active TeamViewer user account |

## Gather TeamViewer credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in TeamViewer. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user who is able to access the TeamViewer Management Console must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate an API token

<Steps>
<Step>
In the TeamViewer Management Console, click your profile menu and select **Edit Profile**. 

</Step>
<Step>
On the **Apps** tab, click **Create Script Token**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new API token a name, such as "ConductorOne". 

</Step>
<Step>

Set the relevant permissions: 

   To give ConductorOne sync (READ) access: 

    * View account data - Required to sync user information 
    * View email address - Required to sync user email addresses
    * View online state - Required for last login
    * View license - To see active state
    * View users - Required to sync users
    * Read user groups - Required to sync user groups

  To give ConductorOne sync and provision (READ/WRITE) access: 

    * View account data - Required to sync user information 
    * View email address - Required to sync user email addresses
    * View online state - Required for last login
    * View license - To see active state
    * View users - Required to sync users
    * Read user groups - Required to sync user groups
    * Edit account properties - Required to update user properties (such as enabling/disabling accounts)
    * Create users - Required to provision accounts
    * Edit users - Required to update user properties and manage role assignments
    * Edit user groups - Required to manage group memberships 
    * Create user groups - Required to create user groups
    * Delete user groups - Required to delete user groups

  These permissions are optional, and are only required for advanced group management operations: 

    * Read groups - To view group information
    * Create groups, Edit groups, Delete groups - For full group management
    * Share and unshare groups - For sharing groups with other users
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. Carefully copy and save the newly generated API token. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the TeamViewer connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of TeamViewer credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **TeamViewer** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new TeamViewer connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your API token in the **API token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you want the connector to sync group information form TeamViewer, click to enable **Sync groups**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your TeamViewer connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the TeamViewer connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Resources 

[Contact ConductorOne's support team](mailto:support@conductorone.com) to download the latest version of the connector.

### Step 1: Set up a new TeamViewer connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new TeamViewer connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your TeamViewer connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-teamviewer-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-teamviewer-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # TeamViewer credentials
  BATON_API_TOKEN: <TeamViewer API token>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to sync group information
  BATON_SYNC_GROUPS: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-teamviewer.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-teamviewer
  labels:
    app: baton-teamviewer
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-teamviewer
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-teamviewer
        baton: true
        baton-app: teamviewer
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-teamviewer
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-teamviewer:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-teamviewer
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-teamviewer-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the TeamViewer connector to. TeamViewer data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>

</Steps>

**That's it!** Your TeamViewer connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
