<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Gather Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

To set up the Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM connector, you'll need: 

- **Base URL**: The complete base URL for your Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM instance REST API, which is formed like `https://your-instance.oraclecloud.com`.

- **Username and password**: The username and password for an Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM account with access to the Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM REST API. This account must have access to the userAccounts (Get,Describe) resource. These permissions are available in the any of the following roles:

   - Use REST Service - User Accounts as Worker (ORA_PER_REST_SERVICE_ACCESS_USER_ACCOUNTS_AS_WORKER)
   - Use REST Service - User Accounts (ORA_PER_REST_SERVICE_ACCESS_USER_ACCOUNTS)
   - Use REST Service - User Accounts as Manager or HR (ORA_PER_REST_SERVICE_ACCESS_USER_ACCOUNTS_AS_MGR_OR_HR)
   - Human Capital Management Integration Specialist (ORA_HRC_HUMAN_CAPITAL_MANAGEMENT_INTEGRATION_SPECIALIST_JOB)

  Additionally, the account must have permissions to read all users' data. A Data Security role with View All users scope for Person and Public Person must be set, either on the user or the user’s role. If the account used to connect does not have this capability, the connector will sync an empty or incomplete list of accounts. 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the credentials you gathered in the previous section.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM credentials
  BATON_BASE_URL: <Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM REST API base URL>
  BATON_PASSWORD: <Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM account username>
  BATON_USERNAME: <Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM account password>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm
  labels:
    app: baton-oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm
        baton: true
        baton-app: oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-oracle-fusion-cloud-hcm-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM connector to. Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
