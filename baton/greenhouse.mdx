## Capabilities

| Resource | Sync | Provision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Accounts | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |
| Roles | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | See below |

The Greenhouse connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). Note that newly provisioned accounts will be created with Basic user permissions. 

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Greenhouse.

The connector syncs roles, including roles for job permissions and future job permissions. 

Due to limitations of the Greenhouse API, this connector cannot provision all role assignments, but it can be used to revoke the Site Admin user permission from an account. You cannot revoke this permission from a non-human identity or from your own account.  

## Gather Greenhouse credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Greenhouse. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with the **Site Admin** user permission must complete this task.
</Warning>

### Create a new Harvest API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In Greenhouse, click **Configure** (the gear icon) and select **Dev Center**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **API Credential Management**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create new API key** and fill out the form:

   - **API Type**: Harvest
   - **Partner**: Custom integration
   - **Description**: ConductorOne integration
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Manage Permissions**. The new key is generated.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the API key, then click **I have stored the API Key**.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Grant the API key permissions

<Steps>
<Step>
On the next screen, select the relevant permissions:

   To give ConductorOne **READ** (sync) permissions:

   - User roles - Get: List User Roles

   To give ConductorOne **READ/WRITE** (sync and provision) permissions:

   - User roles - All permissions
   - Users - All permissions
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Greenhouse connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Greenhouse credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Greenhouse** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Greenhouse connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste your Greenhouse API token into the **Greenhouse Username (API Token)** field. (Greenhouse uses API tokens as usernames when authenticating.)
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you're using the Greenhouse connector to deprovision Site Admin user permissions, enter the email of a user with Site Admin permissions in the **On behalf of** field. This email address will be logged as the [responsible party for the permission change in the Greenhouse audit log](https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html#delete-remove-a-job-permission).
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Greenhouse connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Greenhouse](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-greenhouse) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Greenhouse connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Greenhouse connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Greenhouse connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-greenhouse-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-greenhouse-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Greenhouse credentials
  BATON_USERNAME: <Your Greenhouse API token (Greenhouse uses API tokens as usernames when authenticating)>

  # Optional: Include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: Include if you want to use ConductorOne to deprovision Site Admin user permissions
  BATON_ON_BEHALF_OF_EMAIL: <Email of a user with Site Admin permissions, who will be logged as the responsible party>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-greenhouse.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-greenhouse
  labels:
    app: baton-greenhouse
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-greenhouse
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-greenhouse
        baton: true
        baton-app: greenhouse
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-greenhouse
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-greenhouse:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-greenhouse
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-greenhouse-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Greenhouse connector to. Greenhouse data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Greenhouse connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
