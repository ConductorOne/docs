## Gather Xero credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Xero. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the ability to create a Xero app for your organization must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a Xero web app and generate credentials

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into `developer.xero.com` and click **New app**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Add a new app** form, give the app a name, such as "ConductorOne" and select **Web app**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter `https://developer.xero.com` in the **Company or application URL** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter `https://localhost:8080` in the **Redirect URI** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create app**. 
</Step>
<Step>
The new app opens. In the navigation panel on the left, click **Configuration**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the app's **Client ID**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate a secret**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the **Client secret**. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Xero connector 

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Xero credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

*Due to limitations in Xero's regional availability for custom integration development, ConductorOne cannot provide a cloud-hosted Xero connector.*

</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Xero](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-xero) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.** 

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Xero connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Xero connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Xero connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-xero-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-xero-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Xero credentials
  BATON_XERO_CLIENT_ID: <Xero app client ID>
  BATON_XERO_CLIENT_SECRET: <Xero app client secret>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-xero.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-xero
  labels:
    app: baton-xero
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-xero
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-xero
        baton: true
        baton-app: xero
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-xero
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-xero:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-xero
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-xero-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Xero connector to. Xero data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Xero connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
