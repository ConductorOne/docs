## Gather XSOAR credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in XSOAR. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Admin** role or a custom role with the ability to generate API tokens in XSOAR must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate an API key

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into Cortex XSOAR and navigate to **Settings & Info** > **Settings** > **Integrations** > **API Keys**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **New Key**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose the **Standard** API key.
</Step>
<Step>
If desired, set an expiration for the API key and add a comment describing the key's purpose. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the API key the **Admin** role or a custom role with the permission to read user and role data. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save** to generate the new API key. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the API key. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Find your API URL

<Steps>
<Step>
In the table of API keys, right-click your newly generated API key and select **View Examples**.
</Step>
<Step>
Copy the CURL Example URL. The example contains your FQDN, which forms part of your unique API URL. The API URL is in this form: `https://api-{fqdn}/xsoar/`.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the XSOAR connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of XSOAR credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **XSOAR** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new XSOAR connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the API URL of the Cortex XSOAR instance in the **API URL** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key into the **Token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [XSOAR](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-xsoar) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new XSOAR connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new XSOAR connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your XSOAR connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-xsoar-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-xsoar-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # XSOAR credentials
  BATON_API_URL: <API URL of the Cortex XSOAR instance>
  BATON_TOKEN: <XSOAR API key>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-xsoar.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-xsoar
  labels:
    app: baton-xsoar
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-xsoar
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-xsoar
        baton: true
        baton-app: xsoar
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-xsoar
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-xsoar:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-xsoar
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-xsoar-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the XSOAR connector to. XSOAR data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your XSOAR connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
