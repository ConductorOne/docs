## Gather VictorOps credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in VictorOps. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **admin** role in VictorOps must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create an API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In VictorOps, navigate to **Integrations** > **API**.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the **API ID** shown at the top of the page. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **New Key**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Generate a new API key. 

   Select **Read-only** to give ConductorOne **READ** permission to your VictorOps instance. 
   
   If you want to provision access to VictorOps teams using ConductorOne, this requires **READ/WRITE** access, so do not select this option.  
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the newly generated **API key**. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the VictorOps connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of VictorOps credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **VictorOps** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new VictorOps connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API ID into the **API ID** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your VictorOps connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**The [VictorOps](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-victorops) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new VictorOps connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new VictorOps connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app

</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your VictorOps connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-victorops-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-victorops-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # VictorOps credentials
  BATON_VICTOROPS_API_ID: <VictorOps API ID>
  BATON_VICTOROPS_API_KEY: <VictorOps API key>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-victorops.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-victorops
  labels:
    app: baton-victorops
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-victorops
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-victorops
        baton: true
        baton-app: victorops
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-victorops
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-victorops:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-victorops
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-victorops-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the VictorOps connector to. VictorOps data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your VictorOps connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
