## Gather HashiCorp Vault credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in HashiCorp Vault. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

### Look up your Vault token

<Steps>
<Step>
Follow the [Vault UI documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/ui) to log into the Vault UI.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the user menu (person icon) and select **Copy token**.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully save the token value.
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the HashiCorp Vault connector 

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of HashiCorp Vault credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

*Cloud-hosted connector not currently available.*
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [HashiCorp Vault](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-hashicorp-vault) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.** 

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new HashiCorp Vault connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new HashiCorp Vault connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your HashiCorp Vault connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-hashicorp-vault-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-hashicorp-vault-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # HashiCorp Vault credentials
  BATON_VAULT_TOKEN: <HashiCorp Vault token>
  BATON_VAULT_HOST: <HashiCorp Vault address or host, such as http://127.0.0.1:8200>

  # Optional: Include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-hashicorp-vault.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-hashicorp-vault
  labels:
    app: baton-hashicorp-vault
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-hashicorp-vault
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-hashicorp-vault
        baton: true
        baton-app: hashicorp-vault
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-hashicorp-vault
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-hashicorp-vault:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-hashicorp-vault
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-hashicorp-vault-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the HashiCorp Vault connector to. HashiCorp Vault data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your HashiCorp Vault connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
