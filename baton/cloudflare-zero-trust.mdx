</Warning>

### Locate your Cloudflare Account ID

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Log into your Cloudflare Super Administrator account and select **Workers** from the left nav.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  On the **Workers** page, find your Account ID on the right side of the page.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Copy and save the Account ID.

  </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create an API Token

<Warning>
**Alternative credential option:** If you do not want to generate and use an API token for the integration, Cloudflare Zero Trust also accepts authentication via an API key and the corresponding account's email address. Find your API keys by navigating to **My Profile** > **API Tokens**.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Click the user icon and select **My Profile**.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/assets/cloudflare-2.png" alt="" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **API Tokens** on the left side, then click **Create Token**.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/assets/cloudflare-3.png" alt="" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step>
  At the bottom of the page, in the **Custom Token** area, click **Get started**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Fill out the **Create Custom Token** page as follows:

    1. Give the API token a name, such as **ConductorOne**

    2. Set the appropriate permissions for the API token:

       If you want to use ConductorOne to provision Cloudflare Zero Trust groups and roles, set:

         - Account -> Account Settings -> Read
         - Account -> Access: Organizations, Identity Providers, and Groups -> Edit
         - Account -> Access: Apps and Policies -> Read
         - Account -> Access: Audit Logs -> Read

       Otherwise, set:

         - Account -> Account Settings -> Read
         - Account -> Access: Organizations, Identity Providers, and Groups -> Read
         - Account -> Access: Apps and Policies -> Read
         - Account -> Access: Audit Logs -> Read

    3. Click **Continue to summary**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Create Token** and copy the token generated for you.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/assets/cloudflare-6.png" alt="" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** You should now have one of the following credentials sets:

* Account ID
* API token

OR

* Account ID
* The email address associated with your Cloudflare account
* Global API key

Next, move on to the instructions for your chosen setup method.

## Configure the Cloudflare Zero Trust connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Cloudflare Zero Trust credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Cloudflare Zero Trust** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Cloudflare Zero Trust connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

    If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how you'll authenticate to Cloudflare Zero Trust:
    - Select **API token**, then enter the account ID into the **Account ID** field and paste the API token into the **API token** field.
    - Select **Email + API key**, then enter the account ID into the **Account ID** field, your email into the **Email ID** field, and your Global API key into the **API key** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Cloudflare Zero Trust connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-cloudflare-zero-trust) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Cloudflare Zero Trust connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Cloudflare Zero Trust connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

    If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

    Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Cloudflare Zero Trust connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-cloudflare-zero-trust-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-cloudflare-zero-trust-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Cloudflare Zero Trust credentials, option 1
  BATON_ACCOUNT_ID: <Cloudflare Zero Trust account ID>
  BATON_API_TOKEN: <Cloudflare Zero Trust API token>

  # Cloudflare Zero Trust credentials, option 2
  BATON_ACCOUNT_ID: <Cloudflare Zero Trust account ID>
  BATON_API_KEY: <Cloudflare Zero Trust global API key>
  BATON_EMAIL: <Email address for your Cloudflare Zero Trust account>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-cloudflare-zero-trust.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-cloudflare-zero-trust
  labels:
    app: baton-cloudflare-zero-trust
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-cloudflare-zero-trust
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-cloudflare-zero-trust
        baton: true
        baton-app: cloudflare-zero-trust
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-cloudflare-zero-trust
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-cloudflare-zero-trust:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-cloudflare-zero-trust
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-cloudflare-zero-trust-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Cloudflare Zero Trust connector to. Cloudflare Zero Trust data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Cloudflare Zero Trust connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
