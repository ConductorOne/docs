<Warning>
**Yes, there are TWO kinds of Slack integration!** The instructions below connect a Slack Pro or Business+ workspace with ConductorOne so that you can review access data and grant user access to Slack. (We also have an connector for [Slack Enterprise Grid accounts](/baton/slack-enterprise).) 

If you want to install the ConductorOne Slack app, so that you and your colleagues can request access and get notifications about new ConductorOne tasks in your Slack workspace, go to the **Settings** page in ConductorOne and click **Notifications**.
</Warning>

## Capabilities

| Resource     | Sync | Provision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Accounts     | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>   |           |       
| Workspaces       | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>    |   | 
| Workspace roles     | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>    | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>  |

A limitation in the Slack APIs means that [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning) is not currently supported for Slack Pro or Business+ workspaces. 

## Gather Slack credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Slack. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Admin** role in the Slack workspace must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Step 1: Generate a Slack app-level token

<Steps>
<Step>
Make sure you are signed into Slack, then navigate to [api.slack.com/apps/](https://api.slack.com/apps/).
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create an App** and select the **From scratch** option.
</Step>
<Step>
Give your new Slack app a name, such as "ConductorOne integration", and select the workspace you want to integrate with ConductorOne.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create App**.
</Step>
<Step>
Your new app opens. From the menu on the left, select **OAuth & Permissions**.
</Step>
<Step>
Scroll down to the **Scopes** section of the page. In the **User Token Scopes** area, add the following OAuth Scopes:


   - admin.roles:read
   - admin.roles:write (include only if you want ConductorOne to provision access)
   - admin.users:write 
   - channels:read
   - identify
   - team:read
   - usergroups:read
   - users:read
   - users:read.email
</Step>
<Step>
Scroll up to the top of the page. In the **OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace** area, click **Install to Workspace**.
</Step>
<Step>
When prompted, allow your new app to access the Slack workspace.
</Step>
<Step>
Your user OAuth token is created. Copy and save the token value. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Slack connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Slack credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Slack** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Slack connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the token into the **User token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Slack connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Slack](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-slack) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Slack connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Slack connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Slack connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-slack-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-slack-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Slack credentials
  BATON_TOKEN: <Slack OAuth token>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-slack.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-slack
  labels:
    app: baton-slack
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-slack
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-slack
        baton: true
        baton-app: slack
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-slack
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-slack:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-slack-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Slack connector to. Slack data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Slack connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
