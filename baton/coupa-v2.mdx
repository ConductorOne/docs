## Gather Coupa credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Coupa. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with **Admin** access in Coupa must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Look up your Coupa domain

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Log into your Coupa control panel and copy the URL from your browser.

  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/product/assets/coupa-1.png" alt="" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create an OAuth app

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In the Coupa control panel, click **Setup**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for "OAuth" and click **OAuth2/OpenID Connect Clients**.

  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/product/assets/coupa-3.png" alt="" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Create** to create a new OAuth app.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Fill out the OAuth app creation form as follows:
    - Select Grant type **Client credentials**.
    - Give your app a name, such as **ConductorOne**.
    - Leave JWKS URI field blank.
    - Enter the appropriate login and contact information for your organization.
    - Select scopes:

  **You'll need these scopes to give ConductorOne READ access (syncing access data):**
    - core.business_entity.read
    - core.common.read
    - core.user_group.read
    - core.user.read
    - email
    - login
    - openid
    - profile

  **You'll need these scopes to give ConductorOne READ/WRITE access (syncing access data and provisioning access):**
    - core.business_entity.read
    - core.business_entity.write
    - core.common.read
    - core.common.write
    - core.user_group.read
    - core.user_group.write
    - core.user.read
    - core.user.write
    - email
    - login
    - openid
    - profile
  </Step>
  <Step>
  At the bottom of the page click **Save**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Look up your new OAuth app's credentials

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Open the OAuth2 app you just created. It will look like this:

  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/product/assets/coupa-6.png" alt="" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Copy and save the **Identifier** string. This is your client ID.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Show/Hide** to view your client secret. Copy and save the client secret.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Coupa connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Coupa credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Coupa v2** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Coupa connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Enter your Coupa domain in the **Domain** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Paste the client ID into the **Client ID** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Paste the client secret into the **Client secret** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Coupa connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Coupa](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-coupa) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Coupa connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Coupa connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

  Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Coupa connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-coupa-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-coupa-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Coupa-specific credentials
  BATON_COUPA_CLIENT_ID: <Coupa client ID>
  BATON_COUPA_CLIENT_SECRET: <Coupa client secret>
  BATON_COUPA_DOMAIN: <Coupa domain>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-coupa.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-coupa
  labels:
    app: baton-coupa
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-coupa
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-coupa
        baton: true
        baton-app: coupa
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-coupa
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-coupa:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-coupa
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-coupa-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Coupa connector to. Coupa data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Coupa connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
