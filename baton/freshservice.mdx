This connector can also be configured to automatically create and update Freshservice tickets to track manual provisioning assignments. Go to [Configure Freshservice as an external ticketing provider](/product/admin/external-ticketing#configure-freshservice-as-an-external-ticketing-provider) to learn more.

## Gather Freshservice credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Freshservice. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user assigned the **IT Agent** role and an admin role in Freshservice with the following permissions must complete this task:

- Manage Team Dashboards
- View Agents and Agent groups
   - Edit Agents and Agent groups
   - Delete Agents and Agent groups
- View roles
- View Requesters
   - Export Requesters
   - Edit Requesters
   - Assume Requester Identity
   - Delete Requesters
</Warning>

### Look up your Freshservice API key

Before you begin, make sure your Freshservice user has all the role permissions listed above. 
<Steps>
<Step>
Log into your Freshservice Support Portal. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click on your profile picture and select **Profile settings**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Your API key is shown in the **Delegate Approvals** section at the right of the page. 

   If your API key is not shown, an admin user can enable it in **Admin Settings** > **User Management** > **Agents**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully and copy and save the API key. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Freshservice connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Freshservice credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**
<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Freshservice** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Freshservice connector: 

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste your Freshservice subdomain into the **Domain** field. 

   A subdomain is the `example` section of `https://example.freshservice.com`. 
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you want to automatically create Freshservice tickets to track provisioning tasks, click to **Enable external ticket processing**. [Learn more about external ticketing system integrations.](/product/admin/external-ticketing)
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Freshservice connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Freshservice](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-freshservice) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.** 

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Freshservice connector
<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Freshservice connector: 

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Freshservice connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-freshservice-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-freshservice-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Freshservice credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <Freshservice API key>
  BATON_DOMAIN: <The subdomain for your Freshservice account (such as "example" from https://example.freshservice.com)>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-freshservice.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-freshservice
  labels:
    app: baton-freshservice
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-freshservice
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-freshservice
        baton: true
        baton-app: freshservice
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-freshservice
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-freshservice:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-freshservice-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector
<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Freshservice connector to. Freshservice data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Freshservice connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
