The MongoDB Atlas connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

When a new account is created by ConductorOne, the account's password will be sent to a [vault](/product/admin/vaults).

## Gather MongoDB Atlas credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in MongoDB Atlas. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with **Organization Owner** access in MongoDB Atlas must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate an API key in the MongoDB Atlas organization

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the MongoDB Atlas organization you wish to integrate and click **Access Manager**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create API key**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new API key a description, such as "ConductorOne integration".
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Organization Permissions** area, select the relevant permissions:

   - To provision accounts: One of **Project Owner**, **Project Charts Admin**, **Project Stream Processing Owner**, or **Project Database Access Admin**

   - To provision teams and projects, create invitations to the org for newly provisioned users, and sync data: **Organization Owner**

   - To sync data with no other capabilities: **Organization Read Only**
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully and copy and save the public key and private key.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the MongoDB Atlas connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of MongoDB Atlas credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **MongoDB Atlas** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new MongoDB Atlas connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the public key into the **Public key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the private key into the **Private key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If desired, click to enable **Create invite**, which will create email invitations for new MongoDB accounts provisioned by ConductorOne.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If desired, click to enable **Sync databases** and **Enable Mongo driver**. The combination of these two settings allows the connector to discover and sync databases and collections from MongoDB Atlas clusters.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If desired, click to enable **Enable delete database user**. This tells the connector to delete database users that only have the `read@admin` role when revoking access.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your MongoDB Atlas connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [MongoDB](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-mongodb) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new MongoDB Atlas connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new MongoDB Atlas connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your MongoDB Atlas connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-mongodb-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-mongodb-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # MongoDB Atlas credentials
  BATON_PRIVATE_KEY: <MongoDB private key>
  BATON_PUBLIC_KEY: <MongoDB public key>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: include if you want invitation emails to be created for newly created user accounts
  BATON_CREATE_INVITE_KEY: true

  # Optional: include if you want to sync databases and roles
  BATON_ENABLE_SYNC_DATABASES: true
  BATON_ENABLE_MONGO_DRIVER: true

  # Optional: include if you want to delete database users that only have the read@admin role when revoking access
  BATON_DELETE_DATABASE_USER_WITH_READ_ONLY: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-mongodb.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-mongodb
  labels:
    app: baton-mongodb
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-mongodb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-mongodb
        baton: true
        baton-app: mongodb
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-mongodb
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-mongodb:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-mongodb
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-mongodb-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the MongoDB Atlas connector to. MongoDB Atlas data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your MongoDB Atlas connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
