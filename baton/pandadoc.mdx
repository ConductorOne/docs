## Gather PandaDoc credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in PandaDoc. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A an **Org Admin*** in PandaDoc must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate an API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In PandaDoc, navigate to **Dev center** and click **Configuration**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **API keys** area of the page, create a sandbox or production API key ([production keys require approval from the PandaDoc team](https://developers.pandadoc.com/reference/production-api-key)). 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the API key. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the PandaDoc connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of PandaDoc credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **PandaDoc** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new PandaDoc connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the API key in the **PandaDoc API key** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
If you use PanadaDoc's European API instance, check the **Use PandaDoc Europe domain** box. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your PandaDoc connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [PandaDoc](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-pandadoc) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the PandaDoc connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new PandaDoc connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your PandaDoc connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-panda-doc-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-panda-doc-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # PandaDoc credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <PandaDoc API key>

  # Optional: include if you're using the European API instance
  BATON_API_DOMAIN: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-panda-doc.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-panda-doc
  labels:
    app: baton-panda-doc
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-panda-doc
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-panda-doc
        baton: true
        baton-app: panda-doc
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-panda-doc
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-panda-doc:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-panda-doc
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-panda-doc-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the PandaDoc connector to. PandaDoc data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your PandaDoc connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
