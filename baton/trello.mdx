## Gather Trello credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Trello. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
**Important**

A user with access to the **Power-Up Admin Portal** in Trello must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a Trello Power-Up and generate an API key and token

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Navigate to the [Trello Power-Up Admin Portal](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin) and click **New**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Give the new Power-Up a name, such as "ConductorOne", and select your Trello Workspace.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Leave the **Iframe connector URL** field blank and fill out the rest of the form.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Create**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Navigate to your new Power-Up's **API key** tab and click **Generate a new API key**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Carefully copy and save the API key.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    On the same page, next to your new API key, look for the hyperlinked word **Token** and click it.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Review the application's scopes (read/write access) and click **Allow**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The API token is generated. Carefully copy and save the API token.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Look up Trello organization IDs

Finally, we'll use the Trello API to look up the IDs of the Trello organizations you want to sync to ConductorOne.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Navigate to `https://api.trello.com/1/organizations/[organization-name]?key=[API-key]&token=[API-token]`, passing in the organization's name and the values of the API key and token you created for `[organization-name]`, `[API-key]`, and `[API-token]`.
	To look up an organization name, navigate to the organization in Trello and copy the name from the URL.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Carefully copy and save the ID of the organization.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Repeat the steps as needed to look up the IDs of additional organizations.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Trello connector

<Warning>
**To complete this task, you'll need:**

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Trello credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Trello** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Trello connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Paste the API token into the **API token** field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Paste the comma-separated list of IDs of the organization you want to sync into the **Organizations** field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Trello connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Trello](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-trello) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Trello connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Trello connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.
	Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Trello connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-trello-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-trello-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Trello credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <Trello API key>
  BATON_API_TOKEN: <Trello API token>
  BATON_ORGS: <Array of the IDs of Trello organizations to sync>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-trello.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-trello
  labels:
    app: baton-trello
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-trello
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-trello
        baton: true
        baton-app: trello
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-trello
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-trello:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-trello
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-trello-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Trello connector to. Trello data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Trello connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
