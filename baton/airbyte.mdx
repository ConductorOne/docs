## Gather Airbyte credentials

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Airbyte. Gather these credentials before you move on.

### Create an application

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In the Airbyte UI, navigate to **Settings** > **Account** > **Applications** and click **Create an application**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Give your application a name, such as "ConductorOne", then click **Submit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The application is created. Carefully copy and save the application client ID and client secret.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Airbyte connector

<Warning>
**To complete this task, you'll need:**

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Airbyte credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Airbyte** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Airbyte connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter your Airbyte hostname (in `https://cloud.airbyte.com` format) into the **Airbyte hostname** field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Paste your client ID and client secret into the relevant fields.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Airbyte connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Airbyte](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-airbyte) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Resources

* [Official download center](https://dist.conductorone.com/ConductorOne/baton-airbyte): For stable binaries (Windows/Linux/macOS) and container images.

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-airbyte): Access the source code, report issues, or contribute to the project.

### Step 1: Configure the Airbyte connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Airbyte connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.
	Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Airbyte connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-airbyte-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-airbyte-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Airbyte credentials
  BATON_AIRBYTE_CLIENT_ID: <Airbyte client ID>
  BATON_AIRBYTE_CLIENT_SECRET: <Airbyte client secret>
  BATON_DOMAIN_URL: <URL of your Airbyte instance, such as https://cloud.airbyte.com>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-airbyte.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-airbyte
  labels:
    app: baton-airbyte
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-airbyte
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-airbyte
        baton: true
        baton-app: airbyte
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-airbyte
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-airbyte:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-airbyte
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-airbyte-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Airbyte connector to. Airbyte data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Airbyte connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
