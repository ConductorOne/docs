## Gather JD Edwards credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in JD Edwards. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

To set up the JD Edwards connector, you'll need:

<Steps>
<Step>
The username and password of an account with access to a JD Edwards EnterpriseOne environment configured with an Application Interface Services (AIS) server.
</Step>
<Step>
The URL of the AIS server.
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the JD Edwards connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of JD Edwards credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **JD Edwards** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new JD Edwards connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Application Interface Services (AIS) URL** field, enter the URL of your AIS server, including the port (https://your_ais_server:port).
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Username** and **Password** fields, enter the credentials for an account with access to the AIS server.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your JD Edwards connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [JD Edwards](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-jd-edwards) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new JD Edwards connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new JD Edwards connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your JD Edwards connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-jd-edwards-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-jd-edwards-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # JD Edwards credentials
  BATON_AIS_URL: <JD Edwards AIS Server URL, including the port (https://your_ais_server:port)>
  BATON_PASSWORD: <JD Edwards EnterpriseOne password>
  BATON_USERNAME: <JD Edwards EnterpriseOne username>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-jd-edwards.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-jd-edwards
  labels:
    app: baton-jd-edwards
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-jd-edwards
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-jd-edwards
        baton: true
        baton-app: jd-edwards
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-jd-edwards
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-jd-edwards:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-jd-edwards
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-jd-edwards-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the JD Edwards connector to. JD Edwards data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your JD Edwards connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
