The Jira Data Center connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

When a new account is created by ConductorOne, the account's password will be sent to a [vault](/product/admin/vaults).

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Jira.

This connector can also be configured to automatically create and update Jira tickets to track manual provisioning assignments. Go to [Configure Jira Data Center as an external ticketing provider](/product/admin/external-ticketing#configure-jira-data-center-as-an-external-ticketing-provider) to learn more.

## Gather Jira Data Center credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Jira Data Center. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
**Important**

The Jira Data Center user account used to generate these credentials must have the following permissions:

- View users, groups, and projects
- View project roles
- Manage group memberships (required if you are using the connector for provisioning)
- Manage project role memberships (required if you are using the connector for provisioning)
- Create issues (required if you are using the connector as an external ticketing provider)
</Warning>

### Generate a personal access token

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In Jira Data Center, navigate to your account and click **Profile**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Personal Access Tokens**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Select **Create token** and give your new token a name, such as "ConductorOne".
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Create**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Carefully copy and save the personal access token.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Jira Data Center connector

<Warning>
**To complete this task, you'll need:**

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Jira Data Center credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

Cloud-hosted connector not currently available.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Jira Data Center](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-jira-datacenter) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Jira Data Center connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Jira Data Center connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.
	Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Jira Data Center connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-jira-datacenter-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-jira-datacenter-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Jira Data Center credentials
  BATON_ACCESS_TOKEN: <Jira Data Center personal access token>
  BATON_INSTANCE_URL: <URL where Jira Data Center is hosted, in https://localhost:8080 format>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-jira-datacenter.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-jira-datacenter
  labels:
    app: baton-jira-datacenter
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-jira-datacenter
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-jira-datacenter
        baton: true
        baton-app: jira-datacenter
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-jira-datacenter
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-jira-datacenter:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-jira-datacenter
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-jira-datacenter-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Jira Data Center connector to. Jira Data Center data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Jira Data Center connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
