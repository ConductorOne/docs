## Which Workday connector should I use? 

ConductorOne offers two Workday connectors: Workday and Workday Accounts. How you want to work with Workday in ConductorOne will determine which one you should set up.

* **[Workday connector](/baton/workday)**: This connector is the best choice if you want to use Workday as a [directory](/product/admin/directory). You’ll also need it if you want to enable access requests for Workday role and group assignments. 

* **[Workday Accounts connector](/baton/workday-wql)**: This connector utilizes the Workday Query Language (WQL), which allows it to pull a different data set than the Workday connector. Workday Accounts is the best choice if you want to review who has what kind of access to Workday in your organization, including account type and service center assignments.

## Gather Workday credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Workday. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the permission to create a new API client in Workday must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Look up your Workday REST API endpoint

<Steps>
<Step>
In Workday, use the search bar to look up "View API Clients". Make sure to select this name from the results, not the similarly named "Register API Client". 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the Workday REST API endpoint.  
</Step>
</Steps>

### Create a new Workday API client

<Steps>
<Step>
In Workday, use the search bar to look up "Register API Client for Integrations". Make sure to select this name from the results, not the similarly named "Register API Client".

| Get and Put        | User-Based Security Group Administration  | System           | User-Based Security Group Provisioning |
</Step>
<Step>
Click **OK**. 

   Security group permissions will not take effect until they are activated in the following steps.
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Activate pending security policy changes 

<Steps>
<Step>
Next, activate the security policy changes. Search for "Activate Pending Security Policy Changes". 
</Step>
<Step>
Add a comment about the change you're making and click **OK**.

Click the three dots icon next to the account name and navigate to **Security Profile** > **Assign Integration System Security Groups**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the security group you created and click **OK**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Optional: Look up security group types

If you want ConductorOne to sync specific non-user-based security group types (such as `Role-Based Security Group (Constrained)` and `Integration System Security Group`), you'll need to gather the list of these types. 

Non-user-based security group types are defined and configured in Workday, and their exact names vary based on how your Workday instance is configured. Remember that security group type names are cases-sensitive. 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Workday Accounts connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Workday Accounts credentials generated by following the instructions above

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
   <Step>
   In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
   </Step>
   <Step>
   Search for **Workday Accounts** and click **Add**. 
   </Step>
   <Step>
   Choose how to set up the new Workday Accounts connector: 

      * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
      * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
      * Create a new managed app
   </Step>
   <Step>
   Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

      If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.

   </Step>
   <Step>
   Click **Next**.
   </Step>
   <Step>
   Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
   </Step>
   <Step>

   </Step>
   <Step>
   Click **Save**.
   </Step>
   <Step>
   The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
   </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Workday Accounts connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the Workday Accounts connector, hosted and run in your own environment. [Contact ConductorOne's support team](mailto:support@conductorone.com) to download the latest version of the connector and get detailed setup instructions.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Workday Accounts connector

<Steps>
   <Step>
   In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
   </Step>
   <Step>
   Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
   </Step>
   <Step>
   Choose how to set up the new Workday Accounts connector: 

      * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

      * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

      * Create a new managed app
   </Step>
   <Step>
   Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

      If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
   </Step>
   <Step>
   Click **Next**.
   </Step>
   <Step>
   In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
   </Step>
   <Step>
   Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

      Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
   </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Workday Accounts connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-workday-wql-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-workday-wql-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Workday credentials
  BATON_WORKDAY_REST_API_ENDPOINT: <Workday REST API endpoint>
  BATON_WORKDAY_CLIENT_ID: <Workday API client ID>
  BATON_WORKDAY_CLIENT_SECRET: <Workday API client secret>
  BATON_WORKDAY_REFRESH_TOKEN: <Workday API client refresh token>

  # Optional: include if you want to sync resource IDs
  BATON_SYNC_RESOURCES: <List of the resource IDs to sync>

  # Optional: include if you want to sync service centers
  BATON_SYNC_SERVICE_CENTERS: true

  # Optional: include if you want to sync user-based security groups (default is true)
  BATON_SYNC_USER_BASED_SECURITY_GROUPS: true

  # Optional: include if you want to limit the synced user-based security groups to the types listed here
  BATON_USER_BASED_SECURITY_GROUP_FILTER: <List of user-based security group types to sync>

  # Optional: include if you want to limit the synced security groups to the groups listed here
  BATON_SECURITY_GROUP_FILTER: <List of the names of other security groups to sync>

  # Optional: include if you want to limit the synced security groups to the types listed here
  BATON_SECURITY_GROUP_TYPE_FILTER: <List of other security group types to sync>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-workday-wql.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-workday-wql
  labels:
    app: baton-workday-wql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-workday-wql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-workday-wql
        baton: true
        baton-app: workday-wql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-workday-wql
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-workday-wql:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-workday-wql
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-workday-wql-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Workday Accounts connector to. Workday Accounts data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>


**That's it!** Your Workday Accounts connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
