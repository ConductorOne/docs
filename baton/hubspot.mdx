| Accounts | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |  |
| Teams | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |

*HubSpot roles are only supported on the free or higher versions of **Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub,** and **Content Hub**. Role syncing and provisioning via this connector are not available when using any other HubSpot product or version. 

## Gather HubSpot credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in HubSpot. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Super admin** role in HubSpot must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a private app and generate an access token

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into HubSpot and navigate **Settings** > **Private Apps**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create a private app**
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Basic info** tab, enter a name (such as "ConductorOne") and description for the new app.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Scopes** tab, select the following scopes:

  In the **Settings** area:

   - `settings.users` - Read
   - `settings.users.teams` - Read

  In the **Standard** area:

  - `account-info.security.read` - Request
  - `integration-sync` - Request
  - `oauth` - Request
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you want to use ConductorOne to provision roles, search for and add either `settings.users.write` OR `crm.objects.users.write`.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** To sync user status, search for and add the `crm.objects.users.read` scope to the app.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create app** and confirm your action.
</Step>
<Step>
The new private app's token is shown. Carefully copy and save the token.
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the HubSpot connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of HubSpot credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **HubSpot** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new HubSpot connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the private app access token into the **API client secret** field.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional**. If you want to sync user statuses from Hubspot, click to **Enable user status**.

   This option requires the `crm.objects.users.read` scope, so make sure you've added it to your private app before you proceed.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your HubSpot connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Hubspot](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-hubspot) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new HubSpot connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new HubSpot connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your HubSpot connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-hubspot-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-hubspot-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # HubSpot credentials
  BATON_TOKEN: <HubSpot private access token>

  # Optional: include if you want to sync user statuses (requires the crm.objects.users.read scope on the private app)
  BATON_USER_STATUS: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-hubspot.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-hubspot
  labels:
    app: baton-hubspot
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-hubspot
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-hubspot
        baton: true
        baton-app: hubspot
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-hubspot
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-hubspot:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-hubspot-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the HubSpot connector to. HubSpot data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your HubSpot connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
