## Gather Linode credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Linode. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

### Generate an authentication token

<Steps>
<Step>
In Cloud Manager, navigate to your profile menu and select **API Tokens**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create a Personal Access Token**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new token a name, such as "ConductorOne", and set an expiration.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the **Read Only** permission for **Accounts**. `<!--this is Mindy'a best guess from https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloud-computing/docs/manage-personal-access-tokens-->`
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create Token**. Carefully copy and save the new token.
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.  

## Configure the Linode connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Linode credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Linode** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Linode connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your token into the **Linode authentication token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the Linode API URL you use in the **Linode API URL** field. Default is `https://api.linode.com/v4/`.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Linode connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Linode](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-linode) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the Linode connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Linode connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Linode connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-linode-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-linode-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Linode credentials
  BATON_TOKEN: <Linode API token>
  BATON_API_URL: <Linode API URL - Default is "https://api.linode.com/v4/">
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-linode.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-linode
  labels:
    app: baton-linode
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-linode
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-linode
        baton: true
        baton-app: linode
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-linode
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-linode:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-linode-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Linode connector to. Linode data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Linode connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
