## Gather Confluence credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Confluence. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
**Important**

A user with **Administrator** access in Confluence must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create an API token

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Log into your Confluence account with Administrator access.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Navigate to [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Create API token**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Give your token a label, such as **ConductorOne**, and click **Create**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Carefully copy and save the newly generated API token.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Confluence connector

<Warning>
**To complete this task, you'll need:**

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Confluence credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Confluence v2** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Confluence connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter your Confluence domain (the URL of your Confluence instance is `<YOUR DOMAIN>.atlassian.net`) into the **Confluence site domain** field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter the username for your Confluence account in the **Username** field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Paste the API token into the **API key** field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    **Optional.** If want to sync information on Confluence users' personal spaces and their permissions, uncheck the **Skip syncing personal spaces and their permissions** box.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Confluence connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Confluence](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-confluence) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

## Spaces entitlements synced by default

Each Confluence Space has its own set of permissions and allowed actions, which can result in a very large set of entitlement and grant access information in each Space. In order to reduce sync times, the Confluence connector only syncs a limited set of Spaces entitlements.

By default, the Confluence connector syncs entitlements formed by valid pairs of the following targets (nouns) and operators (verbs), such as `administer-space` or `create-page`.

Default targets (nouns):

- `attachment`
- `blogpost`
- `comment`
- `page`
- `space`

Default operators (verbs):

- `administer`
- `archive`
- `create`
- `delete`
- `export`
- `read`
- `restrict_content`
- `update`

Not all target-operator (noun-verb) pairs are valid.

To change or limit what the Confluence connector syncs to ConductorOne, use the `--noun` and `--verb` flags when setting up the Confluence connector in self-hosted mode. See the [baton-confluence repo's README](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-confluence) for more information.
