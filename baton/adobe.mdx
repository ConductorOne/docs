<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.**

This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Availability

This connector requires Adobe enterprise-level licenses. Standard Creative Cloud or individual Adobe product licenses are not supported.

**Additional functionality:**

The Adobe connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

## Gather Adobe credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Adobe. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
**Important**

A user with the **System Administrator** or **Product Administrator** role in Adobe Admin Console must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Look up your organization ID

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In the Adobe Admin console, navigate to **Settings** > **Organization**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Make a note of your organization ID (it's in `ABC123@AdobeOrg` format).
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Create a new OAuth Server-to-Server credential

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In the Adobe Admin console, create a new project.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Add API** and select **User Management API**.

	- To give ConductorOne sync-only (READ) access, give the User Management API **read access**
	- To give ConductorOne sync and provision (READ/WRITE) access, give the User Management API **read/write access** and **Product Profile management permissions**
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose the **OAuth Server-to-Server** authentication type.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save configured API**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Locate the **Credentials** section of the project and carefully copy and save the client ID and client secret.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Adobe connector

<Warning>
**To complete this task, you'll need:**

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Adobe credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Adobe** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Adobe connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Paste the client ID, client secret, and organization ID into the relevant fields.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Adobe connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Adobe](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-adobe) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Adobe connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Adobe connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.
	Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Adobe connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-adobe-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-adobe-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Adobe credentials
  BATON_ADOBE_CLIENT_ID: <Your Adobe client ID>
  BATON_ADOBE_CLIENT_SECRET: <Your Adobe client secret>
  BATON_ADOBE_ORGANIZATION_ID: <Your Adobe organization ID>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-adobe.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-adobe
  labels:
    app: baton-adobe
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-adobe
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-adobe
        baton: true
        baton-app: adobe
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-adobe
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-adobe:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-adobe
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-adobe-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Adobe connector to. Adobe data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Adobe connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
