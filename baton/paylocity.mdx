<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues. 

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Gather Paylocity credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Paylocity. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

To set up the Paylocity connector, you'll need:

* Client ID and client secret, which are issued by Paylocity when you request API access 
* Company ID for the Paylocity entity you want to integrate with ConductorOne
* Base API gateway URL of your Paylocity API environment

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Paylocity connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Paylocity credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Paylocity** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Paylocity connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your Paylocity credentials into the appropriate fields.  
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Paylocity connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Paylocity connector](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-pingfed) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Paylocity connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Paylocity connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Paylocity connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-paylocity-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-paylocity-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Paylocity-specific credentials
  BATON_PAYLOCITY_BASE_URL: <The base API Gateway URL for the Paylocity environment>
  BATON_PAYLOCITY_CLIENT_ID: <Client ID for the Paylocity API>
  BATON_PAYLOCITY_CLIENT_SECRET: <Client ID for the Paylocity API>
  BATON_PAYLOCITY_COMPANY_ID: <The ID of the specific company in Paylocity to fetch data from>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-paylocity.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-paylocity
  labels:
    app: baton-paylocity
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-paylocity
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-paylocity
        baton: true
        baton-app: paylocity
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-paylocity
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-paylocity:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-paylocity
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-paylocity-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Paylocity connector to. Paylocity data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Paylocity connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
