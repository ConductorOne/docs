*The Account Owner and Finance Manager roles are synced but cannot be provisioned.

The Temporal Cloud connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

## Gather Temporal Cloud credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Temporal Cloud. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the ability to create API keys in Temporal Cloud must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a Temporal Cloud API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In Temporal Cloud, navigate to your profile page and click **API Keys**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create API Key**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a name and description for the new API key and select an expiration date (90 days is the maximum allowed value). 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate API Key**.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the API key. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Temporal Cloud connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Temporal Cloud credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Temporal Cloud** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Temporal Cloud connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Temporal Cloud connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Temporal Cloud](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-temporalcloud) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Temporal Cloud connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Temporal Cloud connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Temporal Cloud connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-temporalcloud-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-temporalcloud-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Temporal Cloud credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <Temporal Cloud API key>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-temporalcloud.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-temporalcloud
  labels:
    app: baton-temporalcloud
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-temporalcloud
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-temporalcloud
        baton: true
        baton-app: temporalcloud
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-temporalcloud
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-temporalcloud:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-temporalcloud
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-temporalcloud-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Temporal Cloud connector to. Temporal Cloud data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Temporal Cloud connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
