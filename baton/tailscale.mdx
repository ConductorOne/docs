## Gather Tailscale credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Tailscale. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with the **Admin** role in Tailscale must perform this task.
</Warning>

Choose one of the following authentication methods:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="OAuth client credentials">
OAuth client credentials provide more granular control over permissions and are the recommended authentication method.

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into Tailscale as an Admin user and click **Settings**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Trust Credentials**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **+ Credentials**. A modal opens to create new OAuth credentials.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a **Description** for these credentials (for example, "ConductorOne connector").
</Step>
<Step>
Configure the scopes:

   - Click the dropdown next to **Scopes** and select **All - Read**.

   - If you want to enable provisioning with this connector, also enable **Write** for the following scopes:
      - Policy File
      - Users
      - Posture Attributes
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. The Client ID and Client Secret are displayed.
</Step>
<Step>
Copy and save both the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Store them securely—you'll need both to set up the connector.
</Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>
<Tab title="API key">
<Steps>
<Step>
Log into Tailscale as an Admin user and click **Settings**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Keys**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate API key**. A **Generated new key** window opens showing the full value of the newly created key.
</Step>
<Step>
Copy and save the API key.
</Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Tailscale connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Tailscale credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Tailscale v2** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Tailscale connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select your authentication method:

   - **OAuth Client Credentials**: Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** you generated in Tailscale.

   - **API Key**: Enter the **Tailscale API key** you generated.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Tailnet** field, enter the name of your Tailscale network.

   Find the name of your Tailnet in the top left corner of the Tailscale Admin Panel, next to the Tailscale logo.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Tailscale connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Tailscale connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Tailscale connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Tailscale connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Tailscale connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

Choose either OAuth client credentials or an API key for Tailscale authentication.

**Option 1: OAuth client credentials**

```yaml
# baton-tailscale-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-tailscale-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>

  # Tailscale OAuth credentials
  BATON_AUTH_METHOD: oauth-client-credentials-flow-group
  BATON_TAILSCALE_CLIENT_ID: <Tailscale OAuth client ID>
  BATON_TAILSCALE_CLIENT_SECRET: <Tailscale OAuth client secret>
  BATON_TAILNET: <Tailscale Tailnet (found in the top left corner of the Tailscale Admin Panel)>
```

**Option 2: API key**

```yaml
# baton-tailscale-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-tailscale-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>

  # Tailscale credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <Tailscale API key>
  BATON_TAILNET: <Tailscale Tailnet (found in the top left corner of the Tailscale Admin Panel)>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-tailscale.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-tailscale
  labels:
    app: baton-tailscale
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-tailscale
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-tailscale
        baton: true
        baton-app: tailscale
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-tailscale
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-tailscale:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-tailscale
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-tailscale-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Tailscale connector to. Tailscale data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Tailscale connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
