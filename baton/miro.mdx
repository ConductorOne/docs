| Roles | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |  

The Miro connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Miro.

## Gather Miro credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Miro. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Company Admin** role in Miro must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a Miro app and generate an OAuth token

<Steps>
<Step>
In Miro, click your avatar in the upper right corner and select **Settings**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **Your apps** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create new app**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new app a name, such as "ConductorOne integration" and select a developer team. You can leave the **Expire access token** box unchecked.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create app**.
</Step>
<Step>
The newly created app's page opens. Scroll down to **Permissions** and select the following:

   - identity:read
   - team:read
   - organizations:read
   - organizations:team:read

   If you want to use ConductorOne to provision access, also include:

    - team:write
    - organizations:team:write
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Install app and get OAuth token**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select a team, then click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Your app is installed, and the app's access token is shown. Carefully and copy and save the OAuth token.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Optional: Generate a Miro SCIM access token 

If you want to use ConductorOne to provision accounts, you'll also need a SCIM access token. If you haven't already enabled SCIM for your Miro Enterprise account, [follow the Miro documentation](https://developers.miro.com/docs/how-to-enable-scim).

To generate a new SCIM token:

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Company settings** > **Enterprise integrations**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **SCIM Provisioning** section, click **Generate new token**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Generate new SCIM token** modal, click **Generate**.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the SCIM token.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Miro connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Miro credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Miro** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Miro connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the token into the **Access token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you want ConductorOne to provision Miro accounts using this connector, paste the SCIM token into the **SCIM access token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Miro connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Miro](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-miro) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Miro connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Miro connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Miro connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-miro-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-miro-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Miro credentials
  BATON_MIRO_ACCESS_TOKEN: <Miro access token>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision Miro accounts using this connector
  BATON_MIRO_SCIM_ACCESS_TOKEN: <Miro SCIM access token>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-miro.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-miro
  labels:
    app: baton-miro
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-miro
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-miro
        baton: true
        baton-app: miro
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-miro
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-miro:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-miro
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-miro-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Miro connector to. Miro data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Miro connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
