## Select which attributes a connector syncs

<Warning>
**Important**

This task requires the **Super Administrator** or **Application Administrator** role in ConductorOne.
</Warning>

You can specify which attributes each connector syncs or ignores. This allows you to customize the information that is pulled into ConductorOne.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Navigate to **Admin** > **Applications** and select an application.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    On the application’s details page, click **…** (more actions) and select **Configure connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click the **Advanced** tab. Here you can select which attributes to ignore or build a list of specific attributes to sync:
    - **Sync everything:** Leave **All attributes** (the default option) selected to pull in all available attributes.
    - **Blocklist option:** Select **Ignore attributes** and enter those attributes that you want ConductorOne to ignore when syncing. All attributes not specifically listed will be synced.
    - **Allowlist option:** Select **Only sync attributes** and enter those attributes that you want ConductorOne to sync. All attributes not specifically listed will be ignored.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That’s it!** On the next sync, the connector will follow the attribute sync rules you’ve set up.

## Connector sync pause

ConductorOne automatically pauses a connector’s sync cycle and alerts the connector owner if significant data anomalies are detected (for example, if the number of resources decreases by half between one sync and the next).

When a significant drop in resources is detected during a connector sync, ConductorOne does not immediately apply the change as a precaution against unintentionally removing access. A banner explaining that the sync has been paused is displayed. Click **Confirm changes** in the banner on the application’s page to let ConductorOne know that the change is expected and that it’s safe to proceed.

### Turn off connector sync pause

This monitoring function is on by default, but you can disable it if necessary.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Navigate to **Admin** > **Applications** and select an application.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    On the application’s details page, click **…** (more actions) and select **Configure connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click the **Advanced** tab. In the **Monitoring** section of the page, click to disable **Pause sync when anomalies are detected**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
</Steps>
