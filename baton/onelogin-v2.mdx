<Tip>
**This is an updated and improved version of the OneLogin connector!** If you're setting up OneLogin with ConductorOne for the first time, you're in the right place.
</Tip>

## Capabilities

*You can opt into syncing privilege data; this is not synced by default. 

## Gather OneLogin credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in OneLogin. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with **Administrator** or **account owner** access to your OneLogin account must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create an API credential

<Steps>
<Step>
Sign into OneLogin as an **Account owner** or **Administrator**.
</Step>
<Step>
Navigate to **Developers** > **API Credentials**.

   <Frame>
   <img src="/images/product/assets/onelogin-1.png" alt=""/>
   </Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **New Credential**

   <Frame>
   <img src="/images/product/assets/onelogin-2.png" alt=""/>
   </Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Give the API credential a name, such as **ConductorOne**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the **Manage all** scope.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
When the new API credential is created, copy and save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

   <Frame>
   <img src="/images/product/assets/onelogin-4.png" alt=""/>
   </Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the OneLogin connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of OneLogin credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **OneLogin v2** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new OneLogin connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **OneLogin domain** field, enter your OneLogin domain, which is found in the URL of your OneLogin instance: `<YOUR DOMAIN>.onelogin.com`.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **OneLogin client ID** field, enter the client ID.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the client secret into the **OneLogin client secret** field.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If desired, click to enable **Sync privileges**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your OneLogin connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [OneLogin](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-onelogin) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new OneLogin connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new OneLogin connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your OneLogin connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-onelogin-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-onelogin-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # OneLogin credentials
  BATON_ONELOGIN_CLIENT_ID: <OneLogin client ID>
  BATON_ONELOGIN_CLIENT_SECRET: <OneLogin client secret>
  BATON_SUBDOMAIN: <OneLogin domain (YOUR DOMAIN.onelogin.com)>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to sync OneLogin privileges data 
  BATON_PRIVILEGES_ENABLED: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-onelogin.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-onelogin
  labels:
    app: baton-onelogin
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-onelogin
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-onelogin
        baton: true
        baton-app: onelogin
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-onelogin
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-onelogin:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-onelogin
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-onelogin-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the OneLogin connector to. OneLogin data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your OneLogin connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### What's next?

If OneLogin is your company's identity provider (meaning that it is used to SSO into other software), the connector sync will automatically create applications in ConductorOne for all of your SCIMed software. Before you move on, review the [Create applications](/product/admin/applications) page for important information about how to set up connectors for the SCIMed apps.
