## Gather FreshBooks credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in FreshBooks. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with access to the FreshBooks Developer site must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a FreshBooks app
<Steps>
<Step>
Log into the FreshBooks Developer site. 
</Step>
<Step>
Navigate to the **Apps** page and click **Create New App**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the app the following scopes: 

    - user:profile:read
    - user:teams:read
    - user:account:read
    - user:teams:write
    - user:account:write
</Step>
<Step>
Enter `https://accounts.conductor.one/oauth/callback` as the **Redirect URI**.
</Step>
<Step>
Save the app. 
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Apps** page, click the new app's name. Carefully copy and save the app's **Client ID** and **Client secret**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Go to authentication page**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Allow**. The application is authorized. Carefully copy and save the **authorization code**. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Self-hosted only: Generate a refresh token
<Steps>
<Step>
Run the following curl command, filling in the variables as noted: 

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.freshbooks.com/auth/oauth/token \
-d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
-d 'client_id=<58f1...>' \
-d 'client_secret=c4a8...' \
-d 'code=8749...' \
-d 'redirect_uri=https://awesomeonlinestore.example/redirect'
```
</Step>
<Step>
The response will look like this: 

```json
{
  "access_token":"eyJra...",
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "expires_in":43200,
  "refresh_token":"818c...",
  "scope":"user:profile:read user:clients:read user:expenses:read","created_at":1747105792,
  "direct_buy_tokens":{}
}
```
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the **refresh token**. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the FreshBooks connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of FreshBooks credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**
<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **FreshBooks** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new FreshBooks connector: 

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste your FreshBooks credentials into the relevant fields. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Login with OAuth** and follow the prompts. 

   After authenticating with FreshBooks, you'll be redirected back to the connector setup page in ConductorOne, where you'll see an authorization message.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your FreshBooks connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [FreshBooks](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-freshbooks) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new FreshBooks connector
<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new FreshBooks connector: 

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your FreshBooks connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-freshbooks-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-freshbooks-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # FreshBooks credentials
  BATON_FB_CLIENT_ID: <FreshBooks client ID>
  BATON_FB_CLIENT_SECRET: <FreshBooks client secret>
  BATON_REFRESH_TOKEN: <FreshBooks refresh token>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-freshbooks.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-freshbooks
  labels:
    app: baton-freshbooks
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-freshbooks
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-freshbooks
        baton: true
        baton-app: freshbooks
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-freshbooks
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-freshbooks:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-freshbooks
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-freshbooks-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector
<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the FreshBooks connector to. FreshBooks data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your FreshBooks connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
