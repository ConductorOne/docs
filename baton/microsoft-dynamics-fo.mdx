<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). The user for whom a new account is provisioned must have an existing Entra account with a valid license. 

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations.

## Gather Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user who is an **Application Administrator** (or similar admin role) in Microsoft Entra ID and a **System Administrator** in Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations must perform this task.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
Sign in to your Finance & Operations environment and navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID applications**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Add a new register to the table, filling in:

## Configure the Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**
<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations connector: 

    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

    - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations credentials into the relevant fields.   
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If desired, click to enable **Sync only enabled role assignments**. When this option is enabled, ConductorOne will ignore all roles that do not have the `enabled` status. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations connector, hosted and run in your own environment. [Contact ConductorOne's support team](mailto:support@conductorone.com) to download the latest version of the connector.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations connector
<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations connector: 

    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

    - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-microsoft-dynamics-fo-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-microsoft-dynamics-fo-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations-specific credentials
  BATON_ENVIRONMENT_URL: <Environment URL of your Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations instance>
  BATON_DYNAMICS_CLIENT_ID: <Client ID of the Entra app created to authenticate with the Dataverse API>
  BATON_DYNAMICS_CLIENT_SECRET: <Client secret of the Entra app created to authenticate with the Dataverse API>
  BATON_TENANT_ID: <Tenant ID for your account>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: include if you only want ConductorOne to sync enabled roles 
  BATON_SYNC_ONLY_ENABLED_ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-microsoft-dynamics-fo.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-microsoft-dynamics-fo
  labels:
    app: baton-microsoft-dynamics-fo
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-microsoft-dynamics-fo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-microsoft-dynamics-fo
        baton: true
        baton-app: microsoft-dynamics-fo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-microsoft-dynamics-fo
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-microsoft-dynamics-fo:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-microsoft-dynamics-fo
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-microsoft-dynamics-fo-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector
<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations connector to. Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Microsoft Dynamics 365 - Finance & Operations connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
