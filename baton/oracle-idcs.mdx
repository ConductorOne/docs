<Warning>
**Looking for Oracle WACS or Oracle CCS?** You're in the right place! Use this connector to sync access data from and provision access to Oracle apps including Work and Asset Cloud Service (Oracle WACS) and Customer Cloud Service (Oracle CCS).
</Warning>

## Capabilities

| Resource | Sync | Provision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Accounts | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |
| Groups | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |
| Applications | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>* | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>** |
| Application roles | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>* | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>** | 

The Oracle IDCS connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

*You must opt into syncing application and application role data; these are not synced by default. 

**Application access and application roles that are inherited via group membership cannot be deprovisioned using ConductorOne.

## Performance considerations

1. **API Latency for Grant Operations**: The Oracle IDCS API has inherent latency when creating grants (assigning access to applications or application roles). Due to this latency, we recommend avoiding performing rapid grant and revoke operations in quick succession, as this may result in failures or inconsistent states. Allow sufficient time between operations to ensure the API has completed processing the previous request before initiating the next one.

2. **Rate Limiting**: The connector implements rate limiting to respect Oracle IDCS API limits. If you encounter rate limiting errors, the connector will automatically retry with appropriate backoff strategies.  

## Gather Oracle IDCS credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Oracle IDCS. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Identity Domain Administrator** or **Application Administrator** in Oracle IDCS must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a confidential application

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console, navigate to **Identity & Security** > **Identity** and click **Domains**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the appropriate domain. Your Oracle IDCS API Base Domain is the Domain URL shown on this page (for example, https://idcs-xxxxxxxx.identity.oraclecloud.com).
</Step>
<Step>
In the domain's navigation menu, click **Integrated applications**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add application**, select **Confidential application**, and then click **Launch workflow**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a name for the application, such as "ConductorOne", then click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **OAuth Configuration** page, click **Edit OAuth configuration** and select **Configure this application as a client**.
</Step>
<Step>
For **Allowed GrantTypes**, check **Client Credentials**.
</Step>
<Step>
Scroll down to the **Token issuance policy** section and click **+ Add app role**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select a role that has permission you want to give to the integration (see below), then click **Add**.

   To enable syncing (read-only), a role with read-only access to users and groups, like **Identity Domain Auditor**, is sufficient. To enable provisioning (read-write), the application needs a role with write permissions for users and groups, such as **Identity Domain Administrator**, which includes the Users - Manage and Groups - Manage permissions.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Submit**.
</Step>
<Step>
The **OAuth Configuration** page will display the **Client ID** (`api-access-id`) and **Client Secret** (`api-access-secret`). Carefully copy and save these credentials.
</Step>
<Step>
Activate the application using the **Actions** button in the top right, then click **Activate**.
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Oracle IDCS connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Oracle IDCS credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Oracle IDCS** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Oracle IDCS connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the Client ID and Client secret into the **Access ID** and **Access key** fields.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the your Oracle ICDS base domain into the **Base domain for API** field.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** Click **Sync apps and roles** if you want to opt into syncing application and application role data.

   If you want to sync data from apps such as Oracle WACS or Oracle CCS, make sure to opt in.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Oracle IDCS connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Oracle IDCS](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-oracle-idcs) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Oracle IDCS connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Oracle IDCS connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Oracle IDCS connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-oracle-idcs-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-oracle-idcs-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Oracle IDCS credentials
  BATON_API_ACCESS_ID: <Oracle IDCS app client ID>
  BATON_API_ACCESS_SECRET: <Oracle IDCS app client secret>
  BATON_API_BASE_DOMAIN: <Oracle IDCS API base domain>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to sync application and application role data
  BATON_SYNC_APPS_AND_ROLES: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-oracle-idcs.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-oracle-idcs
  labels:
    app: baton-oracle-idcs
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-oracle-idcs
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-oracle-idcs
        baton: true
        baton-app: oracle-idcs
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-oracle-idcs
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-oracle-idcs:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-oracle-idcs-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Oracle IDCS connector to. Oracle IDCS data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Oracle IDCS connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
