## Gather Torq credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Torq. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the ability to make an API key in Torq must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate a Torq API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In Torq, click your username and select **API Keys**.
</Step>
<Step>

Click **Create API key**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new API key a name, such as "ConductorOne integration".  
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully and copy and save the key's client ID and client secret. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Torq connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Torq credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Torq** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Torq connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the client ID into the **Client ID** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the client secret into the **Client secret** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Torq connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Torq](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-torq) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Torq connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Torq connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Torq connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-torq-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-torq-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Torq credentials
  BATON_TORQ_CLIENT_ID: <Torq client ID>
  BATON_TORQ_CLIENT_SECRET: <Torq client secret>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-torq.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-torq
  labels:
    app: baton-torq
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-torq
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-torq
        baton: true
        baton-app: torq
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-torq
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-torq:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-torq
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-torq-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Torq connector to. Torq data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Torq connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
