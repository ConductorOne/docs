## Gather UKG credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in UKG. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the permission to create a service account in UKG Pro must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Look up your UKG customer API key

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into UKG Pro and navigate to the **Service Account Administration** page by using the search bar.
</Step>
<Step>
Locate the **Customer API Key** at the top of this page. Carefully save this API key.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Create a service account

<Steps>
<Step>
Still on the **Service Account Administration** page, click **Add** to create a new service account.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new service account a name such as "ConductorOne integration" and enter the email address you want to associate with the account.
</Step>
<Step>
Click to enable the **Generate New Password** checkbox.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the service account the **View** role on the following web services:

   - Employee Export
   - Personnel Integration
   - Company Configuration Integration
</Step>
<Step>
Scroll to the top of the page and click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
A new password is generated for the service account. Make a careful note of this password.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Locate your service endpoint

<Steps>
<Step>
Use the UKG search bar to navigate to the **Web Services** page.

   The list of web services for your UKG instance are formed like `https://example.ultipro.com/services/endpoint-name`. Carefully copy the scheme (`https://`) and domain name (`example.ultipro.com`) but **do not** include the subdirectory path (which begins with `/services` in our example). In our example, you'd copy `http://example.ultipro.com`. This is your service endpoint.
</Step>
<Step>
Save the service endpoint. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the UKG connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of UKG credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **UKG** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new UKG connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Customer API key** fields, enter the API key.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Username** and **Password** fields, enter the username and password for the service account.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Service endpoint** field, enter the service endpoint.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your UKG connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the UKG connector, hosted and run in your own environment. [Contact ConductorOne's support team](mailto:support@conductorone.com) to download the latest version of the connector.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new UKG connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new UKG connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your UKG connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-ukg-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-ukg-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # UKG credentials
  BATON_CUSTOMER_API_KEY: <UKG API key>
  BATON_SERVICE_ENDPOINT: <UKG service endpoint>
  BATON_PASSWORD: <Password for the UKG account>
  BATON_USERNAME: <Username for the UKG account>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-ukg.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-ukg
  labels:
    app: baton-ukg
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-ukg
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-ukg
        baton: true
        baton-app: ukg
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-ukg
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-ukg:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-ukg
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-ukg-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
 Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the UKG connector to. UKG data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your UKG connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
