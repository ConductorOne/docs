## Gather Bitbucket credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Bitbucket. Gather these credentials before you move on.

### Create an API token

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In Bitbucket, navigate to your account's [API Tokens page](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Create API token with scopes**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Give the API token a name, such as "ConductorOne", and set its expiration date.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Select **Bitbucket** from the list of apps.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    On the **Select Bitbucket scopes** page, select the following:

	Read scopes:
	- `read:workspace:bitbucket` - Required to read workspace details and workspace members
	- `read:user:bitbucket` - Required to read user information
	- `read:project:bitbucket` - Required to read project information
	- `read:repository:bitbucket` - Required to read repository information

	Admin scopes:
	- `admin:workspace:bitbucket` - Required to read workspace user groups (v1.0 API) and manage group memberships
	- `admin:project:bitbucket` - Required to read and manage project permissions for users and groups
	- `admin:repository:bitbucket` - Required to read and manage repository permissions for users and groups
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Review your new API token's details and click **Create token**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Carefully copy and save the API token.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Bitbucket connector

<Warning>
**To complete this task, you'll need:**

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Bitbucket credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Bitbucket** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Bitbucket connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter your [Bitbucket username](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/update-your-username/) into the **Username** field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter the API token created for this integration into the **App password** field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    **Optional.** Enter the names of the specific Bitbucket workspaces you want to integrate. If you have only one workspace, or if you want to integrate all your workspaces, you do not need to enter anything here.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Bitbucket connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Bitbucket](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-bitbucket) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Bitbucket connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Bitbucket connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.
	Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Bitbucket connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-bitbucket-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-bitbucket-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Bitbucket credentials
  BATON_APP_PASSWORD: <Bitbucket API token>
  BATON_USERNAME: <Username of administrator>
  BATON_WORKSPACES: <Workspace slugs of the workspaces to sync (if not specified, all workspaces will sync)>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-bitbucket.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-bitbucket
  labels:
    app: baton-bitbucket
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-bitbucket
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-bitbucket
        baton: true
        baton-app: bitbucket
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-bitbucket
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-bitbucket:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-bitbucket
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-bitbucket-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Bitbucket connector to. Bitbucket data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Bitbucket connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
