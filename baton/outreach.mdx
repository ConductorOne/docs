The Outreach connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

## Gather Outreach credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Outreach. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user who is an **admin** in Outreach must perform this task.
</Warning>
### Create an OAuth application
<Steps>
<Step>
 In Outreach, navigate to **Admin Home** > **Installed apps**. 
</Step>
<Step>
 Click **Create new app**.
</Step>
<Step>
 Click **Create app**. 
</Step>
<Step>
 Give the new app a name, such as "ConductorOne", then click **Create**. 
</Step>
<Step>
 The new app's details view opens. Click **Feature selection**. 
</Step>
<Step>
 Select **Outreach API (OAuth)** and click **Add feature**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the **OAuth Application ID** and **Application Secret**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a callback URL for your app. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the relevant scopes for the app: 

   To sync access data (READ): 

   - User: Read
   - Teams: Read
   - Profiles: Read

   To sync access data and provision accounts and entitlements (READ/WRITE):

   - User: All
   - Teams: All
   - Profiles: All

  <Tip>
  **Reauthorize the connector if you change which permissions are granted to the OAuth app.** 
  
   If, for example, you previously set up the Outreach connector with READ permissions, then updated the Outreach OAuth app to grant READ/WRITE permissions, you must re-authorize the OAuth app for the changes to take effect. 
  </Tip>
</Step>
<Step>
Save the app. If desired, create a release. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Outreach connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Outreach credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**
<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Outreach** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Outreach connector: 

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the the OAuth application ID and application secret into the **Client ID** and **Client secret** fields.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Login with OAuth**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Log into Outreach and authorize ConductorOne. 

   After authorizing, you'll be redirected back to the ConductorOne integrations page, where an "Authorized as" message is now printed.
   <Tip>
   **Remember:** Reauthorize the connector if you change the permissions that are granted to the Outreach OAuth app.
   </Tip>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Outreach connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Outreach](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-outreach) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Outreach connector
<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
 Choose how to set up the new Outreach connector: 

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Outreach connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-outreach-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-outreach-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Outreach credentials
  BATON_OUTREACH_CLIENT_ID: <Outreach app ID>
  BATON_OUTREACH_CLIENT_ID: <Outreach app secret>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-outreach.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-outreach
  labels:
    app: baton-outreach
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-outreach
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-outreach
        baton: true
        baton-app: outreach
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-outreach
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-outreach:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-outreach-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector
<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Outreach connector to. Outreach data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.

</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Outreach connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
