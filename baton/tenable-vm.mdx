The Tenable VM connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). 

When a new account is created by ConductorOne, the account's password will be sent to a [vault](/product/admin/vaults).

When deprovisioning an account, the Tenable connector **disables** the account, it is not deleted outright. Visit the [Tenable documentation on deleting user accounts](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Settings/Credentials/DeleteAUserAccount.htm) for more information. 

The connector also offers the option to opt into enabling existing disabled accounts if new app access is requested and approved. 

## Gather Tenable VM credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Tenable VM. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with Administrator user role in Tenable VM must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate an API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Tenable VM UI, navigate to **My Account** and click **API Keys**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate**.  
</Step>
<Step>
The new key is created, and its credentials are shown in the **Custom API Keys** section of the page. Carefully copy and save the access key and secret key. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.  

## Configure the Tenable VM connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Tenable VM credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Tenable VM** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Tenable VM connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste your access key and secret key into the relevant fields. 
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** Click the checkbox if you want to opt into enabling existing disabled accounts if new app access is requested and approved. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Tenable VM connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Tenable VM](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-tenable-vm) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the Tenable VM connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Tenable VM connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Tenable VM connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-tenable-vm-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-tenable-vm-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Tenable VM credentials
  BATON_ACCESS_KEY: <Tenable VM access key>
  BATON_SECRET_KEY: <Tenable VM secret key>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: include if you want to opt into enabling existing disabled accounts if new app access is requested and approved
  BATON_ENABLE_ON_PROVISION: true 
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-tenable-vm.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-tenable-vm
  labels:
    app: baton-tenable-vm
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-tenable-vm
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-tenable-vm
        baton: true
        baton-app: tenable-vm
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-tenable-vm
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-tenable-vm:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-tenable-vm
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-tenable-vm-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Tenable VM connector to. Tenable VM data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Tenable VM connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
