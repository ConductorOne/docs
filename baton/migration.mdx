## Why are some connectors marked v2?

We’ve learned a lot since we started building connectors! One key advancement was the creation of the Baton framework for connector development, which ConductorOne launched in December 2022.

Since then, we’ve rolled out updated versions of some connectors that were written pre-Baton in order to modernize the connectors’ architecture, improve their performance, and enable new capabilities. (See the table below for an overview of new capabilities in v2 connectors.)

## What happens to the v1 connector when a v2 is launched?

We want anyone setting up a connector for the first time to use the latest and greatest version, so when a v2 version is launched, we mark the original (v1) connector with a **v2 available** label on your **Connectors** page. This is intended primarily to lessen the chances that someone will set up a v1 connector by accident when a shiny new v2 version is available.

## Are v1 connectors still safe to use?

Absolutely. We continue to support both versions of a connector so long as they’re in use.

If we decide in the future to retire a v1 connector entirely, we’ll be in touch with anyone still using that connector well in advance of its retirement, and will provide support and guidance for migrating to the new version.

## Migrate from a v1 to a v2 connector

The basic process for migration is as follows (see the special note below about migrating IdP connectors):

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Leave the v1 connector running as-is.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set up the v2 connector in a new ConductorOne app.
	When you set up the v2 connector, select the **Create a new managed app** option.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Configure and test the v2 connector as needed.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    When you’re confident the v2 connector is working as expected, remove the v1 connector. You have two choices here:
	1. Remove the v1 connector and its associated app.
	2. Remove the v1 connector from the original app and add the v2 connector. Then remove the v2 connector from the testing app and delete the testing app.
    </Step>
</Steps>

Depending on the complexity of the connected software and how you’ve set it up in ConductorOne, this process might be quite simple, or a bit more complex. Our Customer Success team is always ready to talk through the process with you and provide advice and support.

<Tip>
**Thinking of migrating an IdP connector?** 

If you’re ready to migrate to a v2 version of your identity provider (IdP) connector, make sure to [talk with our support team before you proceed](/baton/migration/). Due to how IdP apps pull in child apps these connector migrations can have some special complexities, and we can help make sure the migration goes smoothly.
