<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Capabilities

| Resource     | Sync | Provision |
| :----------- | :--- | :-------- |
| Accounts     | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>   | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>         |       
| Projects     | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>   | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>         | 
| Companies    | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>   |          | 

The Procore connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Procore.

### Account provisioning configuration notes 

When configuring account provisioning for Procore, you must include the Procore `companyId` of the company newly created accounts should be assigned to. Pass this ID as a string, in the form `"555134325726800"`. 

Optionally, you can pass the Procore `vendorId` to the new account as well. 

## Gather Procore credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Procore. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the permission to create apps in Procore must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a Procore app

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Procore Developer Portal, navigate to **My Apps** > **Create a New App**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new app a name, such as "ConductorOne". 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Next, go to the new app's configuration page. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Data Connector Components** and click to enable **Service Account** at both the **Company** and **Project** levels. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the app the following permissions: 

   * Manage companies 
   * Manage projects 
   * Manage users 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the app's **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Add the app to App Management 

<Steps>
<Step>
Next, navigate to **Select an App** > **App Management**.
</Step>
<Step>
Locate your new app and click **View**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **Permissions** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the projects the app will be available in from the **Permitted Projects** menu.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Enable project directories 

For each Procore project you want to provision using ConductorOne: 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the project's admin settings and click **Tools**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enable the project directory. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Procore connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Procore credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Procore** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Procore connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the Procore credentials into the relevant fields.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Procore connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Procore](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-procore) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Resources

* [Official download center](https://dist.conductorone.com/ConductorOne/baton-procore): For stable binaries (Windows/Linux/macOS) and container images.

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-procore): Access the source code, report issues, or contribute to the project.

### Step 1: Set up a new Procore connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Procore connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Procore connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-procore-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-procore-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>

  # Procore specific credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <Procore app client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT-SECRET: <Procore app client secret>

  # Optional: Include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-procore.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-procore
  labels:
    app: baton-procore
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-procore
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-procore
        baton: true
        baton-app: procore
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-procore
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-procore:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-procore
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-procore-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Procore connector to. Procore data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Procore connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
