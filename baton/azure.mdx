<Icon icon="circle-info" /> This connector pulls account, group, and managed identity information from the Entra ID connector. You'll configure this relationship when setting up the connector.

## Gather Azure credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Azure. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with the **Global Administrator** permission in Azure must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a new Entra application

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Entra admin center, navigate to **App registrations**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **\+ New registration**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the application a name, such as "ConductorOne", and select the supported account type relevant to your Entra installation. You do not need to set a redirect URL.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Register**.
</Step>
<Step>
The new app is created. Carefully copy and save the **Application (client) ID** and the **Directory (tenant) ID** shown on the application summary page.
</Step>
<Step>
Next, we'll generate a client secret for this app. Click **Certificates & secrets**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **\+ New client secret**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the client secret a description and set its expiration.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
The client secret is generated. Carefully copy and save the **Secret Value**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Assign Azure RBAC permissions to the application

Repeat this process for each subscription you want to sync to ConductorOne. Alternately, you can grant a Management Group scope encompassing all the desired subscriptions.

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Azure portal's search bar, type "Subscriptions" and select the relevant Azure subscription.
</Step>
<Step>
In the left-hand menu of your subscription, select **Access control (IAM)**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **\+ Add** > **Add role assignment**.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Role** tab, search for and select the **Reader** role.
   If you want to use the ConductorOne connector to provision Azure roles, also grant the **User Access Administrator** role. Then, on the **Conditions** tab, select **Allow user to assign all roles**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Members** tab, ensure **User, group, or service principal** is selected for **Assign access to**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **\+ Select members**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Select members** pane, search for and select the name of your App Registration.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Select** at the bottom of the pane.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Review + assign** at the bottom.
   Allow time for the new role to propagate. Azure role assignments can take several minutes (typically five to 15, sometimes up to 30) to fully propagate.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Azure connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Azure credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Azure** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Azure connector:

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the application (client) ID into the **Azure client ID** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the client secret into the **Azure client secret** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the directory (tenant) ID into the **Azure tenant ID** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
Finally, tell the connector where to find the identities that will be used for this app in ConductorOne.
   1. In the **Shared identity source** area of the page, click **Edit**.
   2. Select your AWS v2 connector.
   3. **Optional.** Limit the identities pulled from the connector you selected to only those with a certain entitlement by setting the entitlement.
   4. Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Azure connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the Azure connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.
