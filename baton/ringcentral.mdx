<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues. 

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Gather RingCentral credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in RingCentral. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with access to the RingCentral Developer Console must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a JWT application

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into the RingCentral Developer Console. 
</Step>
<Step>
Navigate to **Console** > **Apps** and click **Create App**. 

</Step>
<Step>
In the **What type of app are you creating?** area, select **REST API App**, then click **Next**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Authentication** area, select **JWT auth flow**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Security** area, add the following permissions: 

   * Read Accounts 
   * Edit Extensions
   * Role Management
</Step>
<Step>
Select **This app is private and will only be callable using credentials from the same RingCentral account**. 
</Step>
<Step>
The new app is created. Carefully copy and save the client ID and client secret. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Create a JWT token

<Steps>
<Step>
In the upper right corner of the screen, click your name and select **Credentials**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create JWT**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the JWT a name, such as "ConductorOne" and select the environment where it will be used. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the **Only specific apps of my choice** option and enter the client ID of your newly created app. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create**. Carefully copy and save the JWT token. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the RingCentral connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of RingCentral credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **RingCentral** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new RingCentral connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>

<Step>
Enter the client ID and secret in the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the JWT token in the **JWT** field. 
</Step>
<Step>

Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your RingCentral connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [RingCentral](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-ringcentral) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the RingCentral connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new RingCentral connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your RingCentral connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-ringcentral-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-ringcentral-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # RingCentral credentials
  BATON_RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID: <RingCentral client ID>
  BATON_RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_SECRET: <RingCentral client secret>
  BATON_RINGCENTRAL_JWT: <RingCentral JWT token>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-ringcentral.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-ringcentral
  labels:
    app: baton-ringcentral
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-ringcentral
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-ringcentral
        baton: true
        baton-app: ringcentral
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-ringcentral
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-ringcentral:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-ringcentral
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-ringcentral-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the RingCentral connector to. RingCentral data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>


**That's it!** Your RingCentral connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
