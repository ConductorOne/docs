<Tip>
**This is an updated and improved version of the Sentry connector!** If you're setting up Sentry with ConductorOne for the first time, you're in the right place.

The Sentry connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

## Gather Sentry credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Sentry. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with an **Admin** role in Sentry must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a Sentry API token

<Steps>
<Step>
In Sentry, navigate to the settings menu and click **Personal Tokens**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create New Token**.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Create New Personal Token** page, give your the token a name, such as "ConductorOne".
</Step>
<Step>
In the **PERMISSIONS** section of the page, give the token the relevant set of permissions:
   
   To sync (read) data: 

   - Project: Read 
   - Team: Read
   - Release: No Access
   - Issue & Event: Read
   - Organization: Read
   - Member: Read
   - Alerts: No Access

   To sync and provision (read-write) data: 

   - Project: Read & Write 
   - Team: Read & Write
   - Release: No Access
   - Issue & Event: Read & Write
   - Organization: Read & Write
   - Member: Read & Write
   - Alerts: No Access
</Step>
<Step>
Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Save Changes**.
</Step>
<Step>
Your new token is created. In the **AUTH TOKENS** section of the page, carefully copy and save the token value. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Sentry connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Sentry credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Sentry v2** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Sentry connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the token you generated into the **Token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Sentry connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Sentry](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-sentry) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Sentry connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Sentry connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Sentry connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-sentry-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-sentry-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Sentry credentials
  BATON_API_TOKEN: <Sentry API token>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-sentry.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-sentry
  labels:
    app: baton-sentry
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-sentry
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-sentry
        baton: true
        baton-app: sentry
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-sentry
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-sentry:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-sentry
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-sentry-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Sentry connector to. Sentry data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Sentry connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
