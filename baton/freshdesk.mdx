The Freshdesk connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). 

## Gather Freshdesk credentials 

### Generate a Freshdesk API key

Freshdesk API keys inherit the permissions of the user who creates them. Make sure that the user or service account used to make the API key for the connector has the appropriate permissions: 

- To sync data (read): View permissions for Users (Agents), Groups, and Roles.

- To sync data and provision access (read-write): View and manage permissions for Users (Agents), Groups, and Roles. 

To create a new API key: 
<Steps>
<Step>
Log into your account in the Freshdesk Support Portal. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click on your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen and select **Profile settings**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **View API key** and complete the verification. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the API key. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Look up your Freshdesk domain

You'll also need to provide your Freshdesk domain when setting up the connector. The domain is found in the URL of your Freshdesk implementation. 

In the sample URL `https://example.freshdesk.com`, the domain is `example`.

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Freshdesk connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Freshdesk credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**
<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Freshdesk** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Freshdesk connector: 

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste your Freshdesk domain into the **Domain** field. 

   The domain is `example` in the Freshdesk instance address `https://example.freshdesk.com`.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Freshdesk connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Freshdesk](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-freshdesk) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Freshdesk connector
<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Freshdesk connector: 

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Freshdesk connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-freshdesk-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-freshdesk-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Freshdesk credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <Freshdesk API key>
  BATON_DOMAIN: <Freshdesk account domain>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-freshdesk.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-freshdesk
  labels:
    app: baton-freshdesk
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-freshdesk
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-freshdesk
        baton: true
        baton-app: freshdesk
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-freshdesk
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-freshdesk:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-freshdesk
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-freshdesk-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector
<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Freshdesk connector to. Freshdesk data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Freshdesk connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
