## Gather Buildkite credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Buildkite. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
**Important**

A user with **Team with read membership** access in Buildkite must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Step 1: Create a new API access token

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In Buildkite, select your **Account Name** and click **Personal Settings**.

    <Frame>
    ![](/images/product/assets/buildkite_token_btn.png)
    </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Name your token **ConductorOne Integration** and select the following permissions:

	- Organization Access: your org name
	- Read Teams
	- Read Organizations
	- Read User
	- GraphQL API: Enable GraphQL API Access
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Create New API Access Token**, then carefully copy and save the token.

<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Buildkite** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Buildkite connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
