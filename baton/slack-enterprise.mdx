<Warning>
**Yes, there are TWO kinds of Slack integration!** The instructions below integrate a Slack Enterprise Grid account with ConductorOne so that you can review access data and grant user access to Slack. This integration supports GovSlack. 

(We also have an integration for [Slack Pro and Business+ accounts](/baton/slack).)

If you want to install the ConductorOne Slack app, so that you and your colleagues can request access and get notifications about new ConductorOne tasks in your Slack workspace, go to the **Settings** page in ConductorOne and click **Notifications**.
</Warning>

The Slack Enterprise Grid connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). 

*The connector can sync and provision IdP groups only if SSO is configured for your Slack Enterprise Grid instance. IDP group provisioning is not supported for GovSlack instances. 

## Gather Slack Enterprise Grid credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Slack Enterprise Grid. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with the **Org owner** role in Slack Enterprise Grid must perform this task.
</Warning>

- Access to the set of Slack Enterprise Grid credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Slack Enterprise Grid** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Slack Enterprise Grid connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>

</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Slack Enterprise Grid connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Slack](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-slack-enterprise) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**  

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Slack Enterprise Grid connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Slack Enterprise Grid connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Slack Enterprise Grid connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-slack-enterprise-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-slack-enterprise-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>

  # Slack Enterprise Grid credentials
  BATON_TOKEN: <Slack OAuth user token>
  BATON_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN: <Slack bot token>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: include if you're using a GovSlack instance
  BATON_GOV_ENV: true

  # Optional: include if you've configured SSO for Slack Enterprise Grid and want to manage IdP groups using ConductorOne
  BATON_SSO_ENABLED: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-slack-enterprise.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-slack-enterprise
  labels:
    app: baton-slack-enterprise
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-slack-enterprise
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-slack-enterprise
        baton: true
        baton-app: slack-enterprise
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: baton-slack-enterprise
          image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-slack-enterprise:latest
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-slack-enterprise
          envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: baton-slack-enterprise-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Slack Enterprise Grid connector to. Slack Enterprise Grid data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Slack Enterprise Grid connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
