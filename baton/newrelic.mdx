## Gather New Relic credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in New Relic. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user who is a **full platform user** in New Relic must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a user API key

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into New Relic as a full platform user.
</Step>
<Step>
At the bottom of the left navigation bar, click your username and select **API Keys**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create a key**. The **Create an API key** drawer opens.
</Step>
<Step>
Select **User** as the **Key type**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a name for the new API key, such as "ConductorOne", and add any notes you or your colleagues might need about this key.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create a key**.
</Step>
<Step>
The new key is generated and added to the list of API keys.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **...** menu and select **Copy key**. Carefully save the API key.
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the New Relic connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of New Relic credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **New Relic** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new New Relic connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the user API key into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your New Relic connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [New Relic](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-newrelic) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new New Relic connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new New Relic connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your New Relic connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-newrelic-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-newrelic-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # New Relic credentials
  BATON_APIKEY: <New Relic API key>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-newrelic.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-newrelic
  labels:
    app: baton-newrelic
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-newrelic
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-newrelic
        baton: true
        baton-app: newrelic
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-newrelic
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-newrelic:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-newrelic
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-newrelic-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the New Relic connector to. New Relic data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your New Relic connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
