| Accounts | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>* |
| Folders | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |
| Documents | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | 

The Lucidchart connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). 

*Account provisioning is only available on Lucidchart accounts with Enterprise licenses.

When a new account is created by ConductorOne, the account's password will be sent to a [vault](/product/admin/vaults). 

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Lucidchart.

## Gather Lucidchart credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Lucidchart. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with access to the **developer tools** in Lucidchart must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create an API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Lucidchart developer portal, navigate to **API Keys**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **+ Create API Key**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new key a name, such as "ConductorOne" and set an expiration, if desired.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the key the relevant set of grants:

   - **To give ConductorOne sync-only (READ) access:** `Documents - View` and `Folders - View`

   - **To give ConductorOne provisioning (READ/WRITE) access:** `Documents - Edit` and `Folders - Edit`
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate API key**. The new key is created.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the API key.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Create an OAuth2 client

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to `https://lucid.app/developer#/packages` and click **Create Application**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new app a name, then click **Create**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the new app's **OAuth 2.0** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter `https://accounts.conductor.one/oauth/callback` in the **Redirect URI** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create OAuth 2.0 client**.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the OAuth client ID and client secret.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Self-hosted only: Create an OAuth refresh token

If you're setting up a self-hosted Lucidchart connector, you'll also need a refresh token for the Lucidchart OAuth client.

<Steps>
<Step>
Follow the [Lucidchart OAuth2 access token documentation](https://developer.lucid.co/reference/obtaining-an-access-token) to create an access token.
</Step>
<Step>
If you want to use the Lucidchart connector to provision accounts, give the token the `account.user` scope.

   Account provisioning is only available on Lucidchart accounts with Enterprise licenses.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the **refresh token** included in the token response.
</Step>
</Steps>  

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Lucidchart connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Lucidchart credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Lucidchart** and click **Add**.

   **Don't see the Lucidchart connector?** Reach out to [support@conductorone.com](mailto:support@conductorone.com) to add Lucidchart to your **Connectors** page.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Lucidchart connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key in the **Lucidchart API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the client ID and client secret into the relevant fields.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** By default, the connector syncs Lucidchart documents and folders that are shortcuts. If you prefer not to sync shortcuts (because they don't grant effective permissions or might return 403/404 errors from the API), click to enable **Exclude shortcuts**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Login with OAuth**.
</Step>
<Step>
Log into Lucidchart and authorize ConductorOne.
</Step>
<Step>
After authorizing, you'll be redirected back to the ConductorOne integrations page, where an "Authorized as" message is now printed.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Lucidchart connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Lucidchart connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Lucidchart connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-lucidchart-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-lucidchart-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Lucidchart credentials
  BATON_LUCID_API_KEY: <Lucidchart API key>
  BATON_LUCID_CLIENT_ID: <Lucidchart OAuth2 client ID>
  BATON_LUCID_CLIENT_SECRET: <Lucidchart OAuth2 client secret>
  BATON_LUCID_REFRESH_TOKEN: <Lucidchart OAuth2 refresh token>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Options: include if you do not want to sync shortcuts 
  BATON_EXCLUDE_SHORTCUTS: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-lucidchart.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-lucidchart
  labels:
    app: baton-lucidchart
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-lucidchart
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-lucidchart
        baton: true
        baton-app: lucidchart
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-lucidchart
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-lucidchart:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-lucidchart
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-lucidchart-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Lucidchart connector to. Lucidchart data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Lucidchart connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
