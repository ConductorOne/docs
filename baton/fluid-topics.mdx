The Fluid Topics connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). 

When a new account is created by ConductorOne, the account's password will be sent to a [vault](/product/admin/vaults).

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Fluid Topics.

## Gather Fluid Topics credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Fluid Topics. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Admin** role in in Fluid Topics must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate an API key
<Steps>
<Step>
In Fluid Topics, navigate to **Administration** > **Integration** > **API keys**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Create a new API key. Give the new key a name, such as "ConductorOne", then click **Create & Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
The **Edit API key** drawer opens. Give the key the **Admin** role. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Ok**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Locate your newly created API key in the list of keys, and carefully copy and save the API key. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.  

## Configure the Fluid Topics connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Fluid Topics credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**
<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Fluid Topics** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Fluid Topics connector: 

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the base domain you use for the Fluid Topics API (such as `doc.antidot.net`) in the **Base domain for API** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your token in the **API token** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Fluid Topics connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Fluid Topics](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-fluid-topics) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the Fluid Topics connector
<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Fluid Topics connector: 

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Fluid Topics connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-fluid-topics-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-fluid-topics-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Fluid Topics credentials
  BATON_BEARER_TOKEN: <Fluid Topics API token>
  BATON_DOMAIN: <Fluid Topics API base domain>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-fluid-topics.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-fluid-topics
  labels:
    app: baton-fluid-topics
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-fluid-topics
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-fluid-topics
        baton: true
        baton-app: fluid-topics
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-fluid-topics
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-fluid-topics:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-fluid-topics
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-fluid-topics-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector
<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Fluid Topics connector to. Fluid Topics data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Fluid Topics connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
