<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** 

This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Capabilities

| Resource | Sync | Provision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |
| Group | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |

**Additional functionality:**

<Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> Supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning)  

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Zscaler ZIdentity.

<Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> When a new account is created by ConductorOne, the account's password will be sent to a [vault](/product/admin/vaults).  

## Gather Zscaler ZIdentity configuration information

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in information from Zscaler ZIdentity. Gather these configuration details before you move on.

Here's the information you'll need:

- Zscaler ZIdentity Base URL
- Zscaler ZIdentity Client ID
- Zscaler ZIdentity Client Secret

See the Zscaler ZIdentity docs for information on how to acquire credentials: [View the documentation](https://help.zscaler.com/zidentity/understanding-zidentity-apis)

## Configure the Zscaler ZIdentity connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Zscaler ZIdentity configuration information gathered by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Zscaler ZIdentity** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Zscaler ZIdentity connector:

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the configuration information from the previous section.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Zscaler ZIdentity connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the Zscaler ZIdentity connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Resources 

Contact ConductorOne's support team](mailto:support@conductorone.com) to download the latest version of the connector.

### Step 1: Set up a new Zscaler ZIdentity connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Zscaler ZIdentity connector:

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
</Step>
<Step>
   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Zscaler ZIdentity connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-zscaler-zidentity-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-zscaler-zidentity-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>

  # Zscaler ZIdentity config
  BATON_ZSCALER_ZIDENTITY_BASE_URL: <Zscaler ZIdentity Base URL>
  BATON_ZSCALER_ZIDENTITY_CLIENT_ID: <Zscaler ZIdentity Client ID>
  BATON_ZSCALER_ZIDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET: <Zscaler ZIdentity Client Secret>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-zscaler-zidentity.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-zscaler-zidentity
  labels:
    app: baton-zscaler-zidentity
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-zscaler-zidentity
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-zscaler-zidentity
        baton: true
        baton-app: zscaler-zidentity
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-zscaler-zidentity
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-zscaler-zidentity:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-zscaler-zidentity
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-zscaler-zidentity-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the zscaler-zidentity connector to. zscaler-zidentity data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Zscaler ZIdentity connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
