## Gather Expensify credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Expensify. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with access to the Expensify Integration Server must perform this task.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Log into Expensify and navigate to **Integrations** or click **[www.expensify.com/tools/integrations](https://www.expensify.com/tools/integrations)**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  On the **Integration Server Access** page, copy and save your **partnerUserID** and **partnerUserSecret**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Expensify connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Expensify credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Expensify** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Expensify connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Paste the partnerUserID into the **User ID** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Paste the partnerUserSecret into the **User secret** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Expensify connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Expensify connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Expensify connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Expensify connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

  Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Expensify connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-expensify-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-expensify-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Expensify credentials
  BATON_PARTNER_USER_ID: <Expensify partner user ID>
  BATON_PARTNER_USER_SECRET: <Expensify partner user secret>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-expensify.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-expensify
  labels:
    app: baton-expensify
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-expensify
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-expensify
        baton: true
        baton-app: expensify
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-expensify
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-expensify:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-expensify
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-expensify-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Expensify connector to. Expensify data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Expensify connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
