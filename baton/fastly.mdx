## Gather Fastly credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Fastly. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with the **Superuser** role in Fastly must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a Fastly automation API token

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In Fastly, click on your account name in the top navigation bar and select **Account**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **API tokens**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Create Token**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  On the **Create a Token** page, give the new API token a name (such as "ConductorOne").
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Type** area of the page, select **Automation token** and fill out the form as follows:
    - Role: Select **Engineer**
    - TLS management: leave the box unchecked
    - Scope: Select **Read-only access**
    - Access: Select the relevant services or all services, as appropriate
    - Expiration: If you set an expiration date, remember that the connection with ConductorOne will fail if the token expires.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Create Token**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The new token is generated. Carefully copy and save the token.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Fastly connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Fastly credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Fastly** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Fastly connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Paste the automation API token into the **API token** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Fastly connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Fastly](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-fastly) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Fastly connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Fastly connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

  Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Fastly connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-fastly-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-fastly-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Fastly credentials
  BATON_ACCESS_TOKEN: <Fastly API token>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-fastly.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-fastly
  labels:
    app: baton-fastly
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-fastly
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-fastly
        baton: true
        baton-app: fastly
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-fastly
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-fastly:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-fastly
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-fastly-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Fastly connector to. Fastly data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Fastly connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
