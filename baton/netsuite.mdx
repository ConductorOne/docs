| Accounts | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |
| Roles | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |

The NetSuite connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in NetSuite.

## Gather NetSuite credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in NetSuite. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with an **Administrator** role in NetSuite must perform this task.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Before you begin:** Make sure you have enabled the following features for your NetSuite instance:

- Token-Based Authentication
- REST Web Services
- Suite Analytics Workbook

You'll find directions for enabling features in the [NetSuite documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/chapter_N232138.html#Enabling-Features).
</Tip>

### Locate your NetSuite Account ID

<Steps>
<Step>
In NetSuite, navigate to **Setup** > **Company** > **Company Information**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **ACCOUNT ID** field on the page. Make a note of your account ID. We'll use it in Step 5.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Generate a consumer key and consumer secret

<Steps>
<Step>
In NetSuite, navigate to **Setup** > **Integrations** > **Manage Integrations**. Click **New** to create a new integration.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new integration a name, such as "ConductorOne".
</Step>
<Step>
Check the box for **TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. The new integration is created, and its consumer key and consumer secret are shown.
</Step>
<Step>
Make a careful note of these credentials (they won't be shown again).
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Create a NetSuite role and add it to a user

<Steps>
<Step>
Still in NetSuite, navigate to **Setup** > **Users/Roles** > **Manage Roles**. Click **New** to create a new role.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new role a name, such as "ConductorOne integration".
</Step>
<Step>
Assign the following permissions to the role:

   - Setup - REST Web Services
   - Setup - Log in using Access Tokens
   - Setup - Bulk Manage Roles
   - Reports- Suite Analytics Workbook
   - Lists - Employee Record
   - Lists - Employees

   <Tip>
   **Why are these permissions needed?** The integration uses these permissions to read and query SuiteQL tables containing information on roles and employees.
   </Tip>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
Next, assign the new role to a user. You might want to create a new user for this purpose rather than assigning the role to an existing user. Navigate to **Lists** > **Employees** > **Employees**, then search for the employee by email.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Edit** next to the name of the employee you want to assign a role to.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **Access** subtab.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Role** field, select a role for this employee.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Generate a token key and token secret

<Steps>
<Step>
In NetSuite, navigate to **Setup** > **Users/Roles** > **Access Tokens**. Click **New** to create a new token.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the application (integration), role, and user you created in the previous steps, and give the token a name.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. The new token is created, and its key and secret are shown.
</Step>
<Step>
Make a careful note of these credentials (they won't be shown again).
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the NetSuite connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of NetSuite credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **NetSuite** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new NetSuite connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Account ID** field, enter the NetSuite domain.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Consumer key** and **Consumer secret** fields, enter the credentials you generated.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Token key** and **Token secret** fields, enter the credentials you generated.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your NetSuite connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the NetSuite connector, hosted and run in your own environment. [Contact ConductorOne's support team](mailto:support@conductorone.com) to download the latest version of the connector.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new NetSuite connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new NetSuite connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your NetSuite connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-netsuite-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-netsuite-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # NetSuite credentials
  BATON_ACCOUNT_ID: <NetSuite account ID>
  BATON_CONSUMER_KEY: <NetSuite consumer key>
  BATON_CONSUMER_SECRET: <NetSuite consumer secret>
  BATON_TOKEN_KEY: <NetSuite token key>
  BATON_TOKEN_SECRET: <NetSuite token secret>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-netsuite.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-netsuite
  labels:
    app: baton-netsuite
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-netsuite
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-netsuite
        baton: true
        baton-app: netsuite
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-netsuite
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-netsuite:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-netsuite
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-netsuite-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the NetSuite connector to. NetSuite data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your NetSuite connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
