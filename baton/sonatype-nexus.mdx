The Nexus connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). All accounts must be assigned at least one role; new accounts will automatically be assigned the `nx-anonymous` role on creation. 

When a new account is created by ConductorOne, the account's password will be sent to a [vault](/product/admin/vaults).

## Gather Nexus credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Nexus. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Steps>
<Step>
The username and password for your Nexus account, or for a service account you've set up. 

   Make sure the account used to configure the connector has the relevant permissions: 

   * **To sync (read) users and roles**: Read access to users and roles 

   * **To provision (read-write) users and roles**: Read and write access to users, roles, and user-role assignments
</Step>
<Step>
The host URL of your Nexus instance (for example: `https://nexus.company.com`). 

</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Nexus connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Nexus credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Nexus** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Nexus connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the Nexus credentials into the relevant fields.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Nexus connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Nexus connector, hosted and run in your own environment. [Contact ConductorOne's support team](mailto:support@conductorone.com) to download the latest version of the connector.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Nexus connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Nexus connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

  Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Nexus connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-sonatype-nexus-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-sonatype-nexus-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Nexus credentials
  BATON_USERNAME: <Nexus account username>
  BATON_PASSWORD: <Nexus account password>
  BATON_HOST: <Nexus tenant URL>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-sonatype-nexus.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-sonatype-nexus
  labels:
    app: baton-sonatype-nexus
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-sonatype-nexus
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-sonatype-nexus
        baton: true
        baton-app: sonatype-nexus
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-sonatype-nexus
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-sonatype-nexus:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-sonatype-nexus
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-sonatype-nexus-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Nexus connector to. Nexus data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Nexus connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
