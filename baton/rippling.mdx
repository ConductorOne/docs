## Gather Rippling credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Rippling. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the user permissions to view all users and teams in Rippling must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate an API token
<Steps>
<Step>
In Rippling, navigate to **Company Settings** > **API Tokens**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new token a name, such as "ConductorOne", and set the token's unique identifier and API version. 
</Step>
<Step>
Configure the scopes for the API token, giving it the permission to view all Rippling users and teams. 
</Step>
<Step>
Create the token, then carefully copy and save the token value. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.  

## Configure the Rippling connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Rippling credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Rippling** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Rippling connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your token into the **API token** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Rippling connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Rippling](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-rippling) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the Rippling connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Rippling connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Rippling connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-rippling-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-rippling-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Rippling credentials
  BATON_API_TOKEN: <Rippling API token>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-rippling.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-rippling
  labels:
    app: baton-rippling
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-rippling
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-rippling
        baton: true
        baton-app: rippling
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-rippling
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-rippling:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-rippling
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-rippling-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Rippling connector to. Rippling data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Rippling connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
