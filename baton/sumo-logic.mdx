The Sumo Logic connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). 

### Connector actions

Connector actions are custom capabilities that extend ConductorOne automations with app-specific operations. You can use connector actions in the [Perform connector action](/docs/product/admin/automations-steps-reference#perform-connector-action) automation step.

**Available actions:**

| Action name | Additional fields | Description |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| enable_user | `user_id` (string, required) | Enables a disabled Sumo Logic user account |
| disable_user     | `user_id` (string, required) | Disables an active Sumo Logic user account |

## Gather Sumo Logic credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Sumo Logic. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user whose Sumo Logic permissions include **create and manage access keys** plus **manage users and roles** must perform this task. 
</Warning>

### Look up your API base URL

Based on your your Sumo Logic deployment region, your API base URL will be one of following: 

AU: https://api.au.sumologic.com
CA: https://api.ca.sumologic.com
DE: https://api.de.sumologic.com
EU: https://api.eu.sumologic.com
FED: https://api.fed.sumologic.com
IN: https://api.in.sumologic.com
JP: https://api.jp.sumologic.com
KR: https://api.kr.sumologic.com
US1 (default): https://api.sumologic.com
US2: https://api.us2.sumologic.com

### Create an API access key

These instructions create a service account key to be used for the integration. If preferred, you can create and use a personal access key instead. 

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Sumo Logic web interface, navigate to **Administration** > **Security** > **Service Accounts**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select a service account (or click **+ New** and create a new service account). 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add Access Key**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new key a name, such as "ConductorOne". 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the relevant scope: 

   * To give the key sync-only (READ) permissions: **View Users and Roles**
   * To give the key sync and provision (READ/WRITE) permissions: **Manage Users and Roles**
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. The new service account key is generated. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the Access ID and Access Key. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Sumo Logic connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Sumo Logic credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Sumo Logic** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Sumo Logic connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the API access key's ID in the **API access ID** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the API access key value in the **API access key** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **API base URL** field, enter the base URL you use for making API calls to Sumo Logic. The default is `https://api.sumologic.com`. 
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you do not want to sync service account info to ConductorOne, uncheck the **Include service accounts** checkbox.  
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** In the **Minimal access role name** field, enter the name of a low-privilege role that should be automatically assigned to an account when their last role is revoked during provisioning operations. The default is **Analyst**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Sumo Logic connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Sumo Logic connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the Sumo Logic connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Sumo Logic connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Sumo Logic connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-sumo-logic-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-sumo-logic-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Sumo Logic credentials
  BATON_API_ACCESS_ID: <Sumo Logic API access key ID>
  BATON_API_ACCESS_ID: <Sumo Logic API access key>
  BATON_API_BASE_URL: <Your Sumo Logic API base URL. Default is https://api.sumologic.com.>
  BATON_MINIMAL_ACCESS_ROLE_NAME: <The Sumo Logic role that accounts will be assigned if all other roles are revoked. Default is Analyst.>

  # Optional: Include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
  
  # Optional: Include if you do not want to sync service account information
  BATON_INCLUDE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS: false
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-sumo-logic.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-sumo-logic
  labels:
    app: baton-sumo-logic
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-sumo-logic
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-sumo-logic
        baton: true
        baton-app: sumo-logic
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-sumo-logic
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-sumo-logic:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-sumo-logic
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-sumo-logic-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Sumo Logic connector to. Sumo Logic data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Sumo Logic connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
