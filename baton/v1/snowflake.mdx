<Tip>
**A newer version of this connector is available.** This version of the connector is no longer available for installation. If you're setting up a Snowflake connector with ConductorOne for the first time, use the [v2 version](/baton/snowflake).
</Tip>

## Capabilities

- Sync user identities from Snowflake to ConductorOne

- Resources supported:
  - Roles

## Add a new Snowflake connector

<Warning>
This task requires either the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>

<Step>
Search for **Snowflake** and click **Add**.
</Step>

<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Snowflake connector:

  - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
  - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
  - Create a new managed app

<Tip>
**Do you SSO into Snowflake using your identity, SSO, or federation provider?** If so, make sure to add the connector to the unmanaged Snowflake app that was created automatically when you integrated your provider with ConductorOne, rather than creating a new managed app.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

<Warning>
A Snowflake connector owner must have the following permissions:

- **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- **Manage Grants** global privilege in Snowflake
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Next steps

- **If you are the connector owner**, proceed to [Configure your Snowflake connector](/baton/v1/snowflake#configure-your-snowflake-connector) for instructions on integrating Snowflake with ConductorOne.

- **If someone else is the connector owner**, ConductorOne will notify them by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.

## Configure your Snowflake connector

<Warning>
A user with the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne and **Manage Grants** global privilege in Snowflake must perform this task.
</Warning>

<Warning>
You will be required to choose a Snowflake role with **Manage Grants** global privilege after the initial connector setup is complete.
</Warning>

### Step 1: Locate the Snowflake Locator for your account

<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to the Snowflake connector by either:

  - Clicking the **Set up connector** link in the email you received about configuring the connector.
  - Navigate to **Connectors** > **Snowflake** (if there is more than one **Snowflake** listed, click the one with your name listed as owner and the status **Not connected**).
</Step>

<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>

<Step>
In the **Account ID / Locator** field, enter the locator you looked up in Step 1.
