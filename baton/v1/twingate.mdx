## Gather Twingate credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Twingate. Gather these credentials before you move on.

### Generate a new API key

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into Twingate as an Admin user and click **Settings**.
</Step>

<Step>
Click **API**.
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Generate Token**. Give the API token a label, such as **ConductorOne**.
</Step>

<Step>
Select the appropriate permission level for the API key:

  - **Read only** to run access reviews on your Twingate users.
  - **Read & Write** to provision group membership via ConductorOne and run access reviews.
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Generate**. (Setting the Allowed Range is not required.)
</Step>

<Step>
The new API key is generated for you. Click **Copy** and save the key.
