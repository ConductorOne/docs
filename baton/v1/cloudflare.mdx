<Tip>
**A newer version of this connector is available.** This version of the connector is no longer available for installation. If you're setting up a Cloudflare connector with ConductorOne for the first time, use the [v2 version](/baton/cloudflare-v2). 
</Tip>

## Add a new Cloudflare connector

<Warning>
This task requires either the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Cloudflare** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Cloudflare connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app

<Tip>
   **Do you SSO into Cloudflare using your identity, SSO, or federation provider?** If so, make sure to add the connector to the unmanaged Cloudflare app that was created automatically when you integrated your provider with ConductorOne, rather than creating a new managed app.
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

<Warning>
   A Cloudflare connector owner must have the following permissions:

   - **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
   - **Super Administrator** access in Cloudflare
</Warning>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Next steps

- **If you are the connector owner**, proceed to Configure your Cloudflare connector](/baton/v1/cloudflare#configure-your-cloudflare-connector) for instructions on integrating Cloudflare with ConductorOne.

- **If someone else is the connector owner**, ConductorOne will notify them by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.

## Configure your Cloudflare connector

<Warning>
A user with the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne and **Super Administrator** access in Cloudflare must perform this task.

### Step 3: Add your Cloudflare credentials to ConductorOne

In ConductorOne, navigate to the Cloudflare connector by either:

   - Clicking the **Set up connector** link in the email you received about configuring the connector. 

   - Navigate to **Connectors** > **Cloudflare** (if there is more than one **Cloudflare** listed, click the one with your name listed as owner and the status **Not connected**).
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the account ID you looked up in Step 1 into the **Account ID** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API token you generated in Step 2 into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
