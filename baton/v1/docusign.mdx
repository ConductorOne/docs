<Tip>
**A newer version of this connector is available.** This version of the connector is no longer available for installation. If you're setting up a Docusign connector with ConductorOne for the first time, use the [v2 version](/baton/docusign-v2).

## Configure the Docusign connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne.

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Docusign** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Docusign connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you have more than one Docusign account, add the Docusign API **Account ID** so that the integration is set up to pull the correct data. If you do not specify an account ID, ConductorOne will use the default account for the user (that's likely you!) who logs into Docusign with Oauth in the next step. To add an account ID:

   - In Docusign Admin, navigate to the [Apps and Keys](https://admin.docusign.com/authenticate?goTo=apiIntegratorKey) page.
   - Click to copy the API Account ID for the account you wish to integrate.
   - Return to ConductorOne. In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
   - Paste the API Account ID into the **Account ID** field.
   - Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Login with OAuth**.
</Step>
<Step>
Log in and authorize ConductorOne with your Docusign instance.
</Step>
<Step>
After authorizing, you'll be redirected back to the ConductorOne integrations page, where an "Authorized as" message is now printed.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Docusign connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
