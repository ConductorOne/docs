<Tip>
**A newer version of this connector is available.** If you're setting up a GitHub connector with ConductorOne for the first time, use the [v2 version](/baton/github-v2). 
</Tip>

## Availability

**An updated version of this integration is available.** This version of the connector is no longer available for new installation. If you're integrating GitHub for the first time, use the [updated version](/baton/github-v2).

## Capabilities

- Sync user identities from GitHub to ConductorOne

- Resources supported:
  - Repositories
  - Teams (including nested teams)
  - Orgs

- Provisioning supported:
  - Team membership

### Requirements

Connecting to your GitHub environment, you will need:

- **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- **Org Owner** access in GitHub

## Set up the GitHub integration

<Warning>
This task requires either the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **GitHub**.
</Step>
<Step>
If this is your first GitHub integration, the integration form opens automatically. Otherwise, click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose whether to add the new GitHub connector as a data source to an existing application (and select the app of your choice) or to create a new application.

   <Tip>
   **Do you SSO into GitHub using your identity provider (IdP)?** If so, make sure to add the connector to the GitHub app that was created automatically when you integrated your IdP with ConductorOne, rather than creating a new app.
   </Tip>
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   <Warning>
   A GitHub connector owner must have the following permissions:

   - **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
   - **Org Owner** access in GitHub
   </Warning>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Next steps

- **If you are the integration owner**, proceed to **Integrate your GitHub instance [chosen method]** for instructions on integrating GitHub with ConductorOne.

- **If someone else is the integration owner**, ConductorOne will notify them by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.

<Tip>
Choose the appropriate set of integration instructions based on the type of GitHub access token you want to use with ConductorOne:

- Option 1: Use a [Personal access token (classic)](/baton/v1/github#option-1-integrate-your-github-instance-using-a-personal-access-token-classic)

- Option 2: Use a [Fine-grained personal access token](/baton/v1/github#option-2-integrate-your-github-instance-using-a-fine-grained-access-token)
</Tip>

## Option 1: Integrate your GitHub instance using a personal access token (classic)

Follow these instructions to integrate your GitHub instance by using a [GitHub personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#types-of-personal-access-tokens).

<Warning>
A user with the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne and **Org Owner** access in GitHub must perform this task.
</Warning>

<Tip>
If you're using SAML single sign-on, avoid a `You must grant your Personal Access token access to this organization` error by following the [Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on) instructions in the GitHub documentation.
</Tip>

### Step 1: Create a GitHub personal access token (classic)

<Steps>
<Step>
In GitHub, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the left sidebar, select **Developer settings**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate new token > Generate new token (classic)**.
</Step>
<Step>
Name your token (for example, **ConductorOne Integration**). Optionally, add a token expiration date.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the following **Scopes:**

   - **repo** - select all
   - **admin:org** - select all if using ConductorOne for GitHub provisioning (see the note below), or **read::org** otherwise
   - **user** - select all

   <Warning>
   The **write::org** scope is used by ConductorOne when automatically provisioning and deprovisioning GitHub access on your behalf. **If you do not want ConductorOne to perform these tasks for you, do not give your token this scope.**
   </Warning>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate token**. Copy and save the new token. We'll use it in Step 3.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you use SAML SSO, you must authorize the PAT using [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).
</Tip>

### Step 2: Locate your GitHub organization name

<Steps>
<Step>
In GitHub, click your profile photo, then click **Organizations**.
</Step>
<Step>
Make a note of your **Organization name**. We'll use it in Step 3.

</Steps>

### Step 3: Add your GitHub credentials to ConductorOne

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **GitHub**.

</Step>
<Step>
In the list of connectors, locate and click on the name of the connector with the **Not connected** label.
</Step>
<Step>

Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Organization** field, enter the name of your GitHub organization.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the token you generated in Step 1 into the **Personal access token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your GitHub connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

## Option 2: Integrate your GitHub instance using a fine-grained access token

Follow these instructions to integrate your GitHub instance by using a [GitHub fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#types-of-personal-access-tokens).

<Warning>
A user with the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne and **Org Owner** access in GitHub must perform this task.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Before you begin:** Make sure that your GitHub organization is set up to allow use of fine-grained personal access tokens by following the GitHub documentation on [Setting a personal access token policy for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization).
</Tip>

### Step 1: Create a GitHub fine-grained access token

<Steps>
<Step>
In GitHub, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the left sidebar, select **Developer settings**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate new token**.
</Step>
<Step>
Name your token (for example, **ConductorOne Integration**) and set a token expiration date. Optionally, add a description.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Resource owner** dropdown, select the username associated with the GitHub organization you're integrating with ConductorOne.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Repository access** section of the page, select **All repositories**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Permissions** section of the page, give the token the following permissions:

   - Organization permissions:

     - **Members**: Read and write access

   - Repository permissions:

     - **Administration**: Read and write access
     - **Metadata**: Read-only access

   <Warning>
   The repository permissions are used by ConductorOne to sync and display data on repo membership (ConductorOne cannot provision repositories). **If you do not want ConductorOne to sync and display your GitHub organization's repo data, do not give your token these permissions.**
   </Warning>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate token**. Copy and save the new token. We'll use it in Step 3.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Locate your GitHub organization name
