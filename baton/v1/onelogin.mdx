## Add a new OneLogin connector

<Warning>
This task requires either the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>

<Step>
Search for **OneLogin** and click **Add**.
</Step>

<Step>
Choose how to set up the new OneLogin connector:

  - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
  - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
  - Create a new managed app
</Step>

<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

<Warning>
A OneLogin connector owner must have the following permissions:

- **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- **Administrator** or **account owner** access to your OneLogin account
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Next steps

- **If you are the connector owner**, proceed to [Configure your OneLogin connector](/baton/v1/onelogin#configure-your-onelogin-connector) for instructions on integrating OneLogin with ConductorOne.

- **If someone else is the connector owner**, ConductorOne will notify them by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.

## Configure your OneLogin connector

<Warning>
A user with the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne and **Administrator** or **account owner** access to your OneLogin account must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Step 1: Locate your OneLogin domain

<Steps>
<Step>
Look up your OneLogin domain, which is found in the URL of your OneLogin instance: `<YOUR DOMAIN>.onelogin.com`.
</Step>

<Step>
Make a note of your domain. We'll use it in Step 3.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create an API credential

<Steps>
<Step>
Sign into OneLogin as an **Account owner** or **Administrator**.
</Step>

<Step>
Navigate to **Developers** > **API Credentials**.

<Step>
Click **New Credential**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product/assets/onelogin-2.png" alt="" />
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step>
Give the API credential a name, such as **ConductorOne**.
</Step>

<Step>
Select the **Manage all** scope.
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>

<Step>
When the new API credential is created, copy and save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. We'll use these in Step 3.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Add your OneLogin credentials to ConductorOne

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to the OneLogin connector by either:

  - Clicking the **Set up connector** link in the email you received about configuring the connector.
  - Navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **OneLogin** (if there is more than one **OneLogin** listed, click the one with your name listed as owner and the status **Not connected**).
</Step>

<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>

<Step>
In the **OneLogin domain** field, enter the domain you looked up in Step 1.
</Step>

<Step>
In the **OneLogin client ID** field, enter the client ID from Step 2.
</Step>

<Step>
Paste the client secret from Step 2 into the **OneLogin client secret** field.
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>

<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your OneLogin connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

### What's next?

If OneLogin is your company's identity provider (meaning that it is used to SSO into other software), the connector sync will automatically create applications in ConductorOne for all of your SCIMed software. Before you move on, review the [Create applications](/product/admin/applications) page for important information about how to set up connectors for the SCIMed apps.
