## Gather Sentry credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Sentry. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with an **Admin**, **Manager**, or **Owner** role in Sentry with the permission to create new integrations must perform this task.
</Warning>

In Sentry, click **Settings** > **Developer Settings**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create New Integration** and select **Internal Integration**, then click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Create Internal Integration** page, give your new integration a name, such as **ConductorOne**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **PERMISSIONS** section of the page, give the integration the following permissions:

   - Project: Read
   - Team: Read
   - Release: No Access
   - Issue & Event: Read
   - Organization: Read
   - Member: Read
</Step>
<Step>

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app

Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
