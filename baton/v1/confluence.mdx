<Tip>
**A newer version of this connector is available.** This version of the connector is no longer available for installation. If you're setting up a Confluence connector with ConductorOne for the first time, use the [v2 version](/baton/confluence-v2). 
</Tip>

## Capabilities

- Sync user identities from Confluence to ConductorOne

- Resources supported:
  - Groups

## Add a new Confluence connector

<Warning>
This task requires either the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Confluence** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Confluence connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app

<Tip>
   **Do you SSO into Confluence using your identity, SSO, or federation provider?** If so, make sure to add the connector to the unmanaged Confluence app that was created automatically when you integrated your provider with ConductorOne, rather than creating a new managed app.
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

<Warning>
   A Confluence connector owner must have the following permissions:

   - **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
   - **Administrator** access in Confluence
</Warning>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Next steps

- **If you are the connector owner**, proceed to [Configure your Confluence connector](/baton/v1/confluence#configure-your-confluence-connector) for instructions on integrating Confluence with ConductorOne.

- **If someone else is the connector owner**, ConductorOne will notify them by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.

## Configure your Confluence connector

<Warning>
A user with the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne and **Administrator** access in Confluence must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Step 1: Create an API token

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into your Confluence account with Administrator access.
</Step>
<Step>
Navigate to [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create API token**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give your token a label, such as **ConductorOne**, and click **Create**.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy the newly generated API token. We'll use it in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Add your Confluence credentials to ConductorOne

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to the Confluence connector by either:

   - Clicking the **Set up connector** link in the email you received about configuring the connector. 

   - Navigate to **Connectors** > **Confluence** (if there is more than one **Confluence** listed, click the one with your name listed as owner and the status **Not connected**).
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your Confluence domain (the URL of your Confluence instance is `<YOUR DOMAIN>.atlassian.net`) into the **Confluence site domain** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the username for your Confluence account in the **Username** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API token you generated in Step 1 into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Confluence connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
