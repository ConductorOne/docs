<Tip>
**A newer version of this connector is available.** This version of the connector is no longer available for installation. If you're setting up a Datadog connector with ConductorOne for the first time, use the [v2 version](/baton/datadog-v2). 
</Tip>

## Capabilities

- Sync user identities from Datadog to ConductorOne

- Resources supported:
  - Roles

## Add a new Datadog connector

<Warning>
This task requires either the **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Datadog** and click **Add**.  
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Datadog connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app

<Tip>
   **Do you SSO into Datadog using your identity, SSO, or federation provider?** If so, make sure to add the connector to the unmanaged Datadog app that was created automatically when you integrated your provider with ConductorOne, rather than creating a new managed app.
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

<Warning>
   A Datadog connector owner must have the following permissions:

   - **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
   - **System Admin** access in Datadog
</Warning>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Next steps

- **If you are the connector owner**, proceed to [Configure your Datadog connector](/baton/v1/datadog#configure-your-datadog-connector) for instructions on integrating Datadog with ConductorOne.

- **If someone else is the connector owner**, ConductorOne will notify them by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.

## Configure your Datadog connector

   - Clicking the **Set up connector** link in the email you received about configuring the connector. 

   - Navigate to **Connectors** > **Datadog** (if there is more than one **Datadog** listed, click the one with your name listed as owner and the status **Not connected**).
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select your Datadog site from Step 1 from the list.
