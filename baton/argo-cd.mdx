## Capabilities

| Resource | Sync | Provision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Accounts | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |

The ArgoCD connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

When a new account is created by ConductorOne, the account's password will be sent to a [vault](/product/admin/vaults).

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in ArgoCD.

## Gather ArgoCD credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in ArgoCD. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    The username and password for your ArgoCD admin account, or for a dedicated service account you've set up.
	Make sure the account used to configure the connector has the relevant permissions:
	- To sync (read) users and roles: `get` and `list` permissions for users and roles
	- To provision (read-write) users and roles: `get` and `list` permissions for users and roles, plus `create` permission for users and `update` permission for user role assignments. The built-in `admin` role has these permissions, or you can create a custom role.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Your ArgoCD API URL, which is the URL you use to access the ArgoCD UI.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The `kubeconfig` path or file to connect to the cluster where ArgoCD is running. There are some options here:
	1. **Provided `kubeconfig` file**: If a `kubeconfig` file is provided through the connector configuration, it will be used to connect to the cluster.
	2. **In-cluster configuration**: If the connector is deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster as ArgoCD (such as in the `argocd` namespace), it will automatically use the in-cluster configuration from the pod's service account. No `kubeconfig` file is needed in this case. If one is provided, it will take precedence over in-cluster.
		Find [more information on setting up an in-cluster configuration](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-argo-cd/blob/main/docs/docs-info.md#kubernetes-deployment-in-cluster-configuration) in the connector repo.
	3. **Default kubeconfig location**: If no `kubeconfig` is provided and in-cluster config is not available, the connector will attempt to use the default `kubeconfig` file at `~/.kube/config`.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the ArgoCD connector

<Warning>
**To complete this task, you'll need:**

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of ArgoCD credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

This connector does not support cloud hosting.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [ArgoCD](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-argo-cd) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new ArgoCD connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new ArgoCD connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.
	Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your ArgoCD connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-argo-cd-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-argo-cd-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>

  # ArgoCD specific credentials
  BATON_USERNAME: <ArgoCD account username>
  BATON_PASSWORD: <ArgoCD account password>
  BATON_API_URL: <ArgoCD tenant API URL>

  # Optional: Include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-argo-cd.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-argo-cd
  labels:
    app: baton-argo-cd
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-argo-cd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-argo-cd
        baton: true
        baton-app: argo-cd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-argo-cd
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-argo-cd:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-argo-cd
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-argo-cd-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the ArgoCD connector to. ArgoCD data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your ArgoCD connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
