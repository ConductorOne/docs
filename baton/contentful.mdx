<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

The Contentful connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Contentful.

## Gather Contentful credentials

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Contentful. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with the **Administrator** role in Contentful must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Look up your organization ID

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In Contentful, click the environment switcher at the top of the page.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click the organization's name and select **Organization settings & subscriptions**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Navigate to the **Organization information** tab. Carefully copy and save the **Organization ID**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create a CMA token

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In Contentful, navigate to **Settings** > **CMA tokens**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Create personal access token** and give the new token a name, such as "ConductorOne".
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Generate**. Carefully copy and save the new token.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Contentful connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Contentful credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Contentful** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Contentful connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Paste the token into the **Contentful API token** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Paste the organization ID into into the **Organization ID** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Contentful connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Contentful](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-contentful) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the Contentful connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Contentful connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

  Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Contentful connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-contentful-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-contentful-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Contentful credentials
  BATON_TOKEN: <Contentful token>
  BATON_ORGANIZATION_ID: <Contentful org ID>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-contentful.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-contentful
  labels:
    app: baton-contentful
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-contentful
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-contentful
        baton: true
        baton-app: contentful
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-contentful
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-contentful:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-contentful
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-contentful-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Contentful connector to. Contentful data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Contentful connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
