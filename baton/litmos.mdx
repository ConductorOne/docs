## Gather Litmos credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Litmos. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with **Account Owner** or **Administrator** role in Litmos must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Look up your Litmos API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In Litmos, open your user profile menu and click **My Profile & Settings**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **API key**.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully and copy and save the API key.
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Litmos connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Litmos credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Litmos** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Litmos connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the name of your Litmos account in the **Source** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** In the **Course IDs** field, add the ID numbers of the courses you want to sync. If no course numbers are entered, ConductorOne will sync all available courses.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Litmos connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Litmos](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-litmos) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Litmos connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Litmos connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Litmos connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-litmos-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-litmos-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Litmos credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <Litmos API key>
  BATON_SOURCE: <Litmos account name>
  BATON_LIMITED_COURSES: <Litmos course ID numbers to sync (leave unspecified to sync all courses)>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-litmos.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-litmos
  labels:
    app: baton-litmos
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-litmos
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-litmos
        baton: true
        baton-app: litmos
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-litmos
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-litmos:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-litmos-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Litmos connector to. Litmos data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Litmos connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
