<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues. 

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Gather PrivX credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in PrivX. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Admin** role in PrivX must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Set up a PrivX role

First, create a PrivX role that will be used to grant permissions to the API client you'll use to integrate with ConductorOne. 

<Steps>
<Step>
In PrivX, navigate to **Administration** > **Roles** and click **Add Role**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Create a new role (or locate an existing role) with the following permissions: 
   - roles-view
   - users-view
   - role-target-resources-view
</Step>
<Step>
Make a note of the name of the role. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Create a PrivX API client

<Steps>
<Step>
Still in PrivX, navigate to **Administration** > **Deployment** and click **Integrate with PrivX Using API Clients**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add API Client**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new client a name and assign it the role you just created or identified. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Scroll down to the **Credentials** section of the page. Carefully copy and save the OAuth Client ID and Client Secret, and the API Client ID and Client Secret. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the PrivX connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of PrivX credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **PrivX** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new PrivX connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select your preferred authentication method, **OAuth** or **Client secret**: 

   - For **OAuth**, enter your PrivX base URL and paste in the OAuth credentials.

   - For **Client secret**, enter your PrivX base URL and paste in the API client credentials. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your PrivX connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Privx](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-privx) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Resources

* [Official download center](https://dist.conductorone.com/ConductorOne/baton-privx): For stable binaries (Windows/Linux/macOS) and container images.

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-privx): Access the source code, report issues, or contribute to the project.

### Step 1: Set up a new PrivX connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new PrivX connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 
   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 
   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your PrivX connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-privx-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-privx-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # PrivX credentials, option 1
  BATON_API_CLIENT_ID: <PrivX API client ID>
  BATON_API_CLIENT_SECRET: <PrivX API client secret>
  BATON_BASE_URL: <PrivX instance base URL>

  # PrivX credentials, option 2
  BATON_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: <PrivX OAuth client ID>
  BATON_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: <PrivX OAuth client secret>
  BATON_BASE_URL: <PrivX instance base URL>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-privx.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-privx
  labels:
    app: baton-privx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-privx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-privx
        baton: true
        baton-app: privx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-privx
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-privx:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-privx
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-privx-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the PrivX connector to. PrivX data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your PrivX connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
