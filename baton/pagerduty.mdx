## Gather PagerDuty credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in PagerDuty. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Admin** or **Account Owner** role in PagerDuty must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create an API access key

<Steps>
<Step>
Sign into PagerDuty and navigate to **Developer Tools > Integrations > API Access Keys**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create New API Key**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a description for the key, such as "ConductorOne integration". 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create Key**.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully save the newly generated API key. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the PagerDuty connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of PagerDuty credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **PagerDuty** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new PagerDuty connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key into the **API token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your PagerDuty connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [PagerDuty](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-pagerduty) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new PagerDuty connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new PagerDuty connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your PagerDuty connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-pagerduty-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-pagerduty-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # PagerDuty credentials
  BATON_TOKEN: <PagerDuty API key>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-pagerduty.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-pagerduty
  labels:
    app: baton-pagerduty
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-pagerduty
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-pagerduty
        baton: true
        baton-app: pagerduty
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-pagerduty
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-pagerduty:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-pagerduty
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-pagerduty-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the PagerDuty connector to. PagerDuty data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your PagerDuty connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
