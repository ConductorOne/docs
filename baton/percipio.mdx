## Gather Percipio credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Percipio. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

To set up the integration with ConductorOne, you'll need: 

- Your Percipio organization UUID

- The API bearer token associated with a [Percipio service account](https://documentation.skillsoft.com/en_us/pes/Integration/int_api_rest_authentication.htm) 

Please work with your Skillsoft Account Team to set up a service account for the ConductorOne integration and gather these credentials. 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Percipio connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Percipio credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
 In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Percipio** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Percipio connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Organization ID** field, enter your Percipio organization UUID. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **API Token** field, enter the token associated with the Percipio service account set up for this integration. 
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** In the **Course IDs** field, add the ID numbers of the courses you want to sync. If no course numbers are entered, ConductorOne will sync all available courses. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Percipio connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Percipio](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-percipio) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Percipio connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Percipio connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Percipio connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-percipio-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-percipio-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Percipio credentials
  BATON_API_TOKEN: <Percipio API bearer token>
  BATON_ORGANIZATION_ID: <Percipio organization ID>
  BATON_LIMITED_COURSES: <Optional. Limit synced courses to the course IDs you specify here>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-percipio.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-percipio
  labels:
    app: baton-percipio
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-percipio
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-percipio
        baton: true
        baton-app: percipio
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-percipio
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-percipio:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-percipio
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-percipio-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Percipio connector to. Percipio data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Percipio connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
