<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Support 

This connector is compatible with Metabase versions 0.49 and newer. Older versions are not supported. 

Due to the nature of Metabase's API versioning model, three versions of this connector are currently available for installation: 

- Metabase (unversioned)
- Metabase v0.49
- Metabase v0.56

See the docs below for details on the capabilities of each version and instructions on installing your preferred version. 

## Capabilities

### Metabase (unversioned)

| Resource | Sync | Provision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Account | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |
| Group | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |

The Metabase connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). 

When a new account is created by ConductorOne, the account's password will be sent to a [vault](/product/admin/vaults). 

The Metabase connector cannot fully deprovision accounts, but it can enable and disable existing accounts.

### Metabase v0.49

| Resource | Sync | Provision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| Database | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |  |
| Group | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |

The Metabase v0.49 connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). 

When a new account is created by ConductorOne, the account's password will be sent to a [vault](/product/admin/vaults). 

The Metabase v0.49 connector cannot fully deprovision accounts, but it can enable and disable existing accounts.

### Metabase v0.56

| Resource | Sync | Provision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Account | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |

| Group | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |

The Metabase v0.56 connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). 

When a new account is created by ConductorOne, the account's password will be sent to a [vault](/product/admin/vaults). 

The Metabase v0.56 connector cannot fully deprovision accounts, but it can enable and disable existing accounts.

## Gather Metabase configuration information

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in information from Metabase. Gather these configuration details before you move on.

Here's the information you'll need:

- API Key
- Base URL

See the Metabase docs for information on how to acquire credentials: [View the documentation](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/people-and-groups/api-keys#create-an-api-key)

This connector requires the following scopes:

  - Query builder and native

## Configure the Metabase connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Metabase configuration information gathered by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
As relevant, search for **Metabase**, **Metabase v0.49** or **Metabase v0.56** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Metabase connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the configuration information from the previous section.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Metabase connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Metabase connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Metabase connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Metabase connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Use the relevant files below to create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Metabase connector deployment.

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the metabase connector to. metabase data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Metabase connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
