This connector can also be configured to automatically create and update Linear tickets to track manual provisioning assignments. Go to [Configure Linear as an external ticketing provider](/product/admin/external-ticketing#configure-linear-as-an-external-ticketing-provider) to learn more.

## Gather Linear credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Linear. Gather these credentials before you move on.

### Generate a new Linear API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In Linear, click your profile photo and select **Settings**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **API**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Personal API keys** section of the page, enter a label such as "ConductorOne" and click **Create key**.
</Step>
<Step>
The new API key is generated for you. Carefully copy and save the API key.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Linear connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Linear credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Linear** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Linear connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you want to skip syncing projects, click to enable **Skip projects**.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you want to automatically create Linear tickets to track provisioning tasks, click **Enable external ticket provisioning**. [Learn more about external ticketing system integrations.](/product/admin/external-ticketing)
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** Enter a list of team IDs that will be used for ticket schemas in the **Teams** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Linear connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Linear](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-linear) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Linear connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Linear connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Linear connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-linear-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-linear-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>

  # Linear credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <API key for Linear>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to skip syncing projects
  BATON_SKIP_PROJECTS: true

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to create provisioning tickets in Linear 
  BATON_TICKETING: true
  BATON_TICKET_SCHEMA_TEAM_IDS_FILTER: <(Optional.) List of Linear team IDs>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-linear.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-linear
  labels:
    app: baton-linear
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-linear
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-linear
        baton: true
        baton-app: linear
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: baton-linear
          image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-linear:latest
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: baton-linear-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Linear connector to. Linear data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Linear connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
