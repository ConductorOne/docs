<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Availability

ConductorOne currently only integrates with Notion Enterprise. You cannot use this connector successfully with the Free, Plus, or Business editions of Notion. 

## Capabilities

The Notion connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Notion.

## Gather Notion credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Notion. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Organization Owner** role in Notion must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a SCIM API token

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Notion workspace switcher, select **Manage organization**.
</Step>
<Step>
Navigate to **Settings** > **Identity** > **SCIM Provisioning**.
</Step>
<Step>
Follow the prompts to generate a SCIM API token.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the SCIM API token.
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Notion connector 

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Notion credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Notion** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Notion connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the SCIM API token into the **Notion SCIM API token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Notion connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Notion](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-notion) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.** 

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Notion connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Notion connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Notion connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-notion-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-notion-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Notion credentials
  BATON_SCIM_TOKEN: <Token used to connect to the Notion SCIM API>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-notion.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-notion
  labels:
    app: baton-notion
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-notion
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-notion
        baton: true
        baton-app: notion
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-notion
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-notion:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-notion
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-notion-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Notion connector to. Notion data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Notion connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
