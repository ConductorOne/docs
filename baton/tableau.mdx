<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues. 

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

The Tableau connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

## Gather Tableau credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Tableau. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Server Administrator** role in Tableau Server or **Site Administrator** in Tableau Cloud must perform this task.
</Warning>

To work with the Tableau APIs, you'll need either an installation of Tableau Server or membership in the [Tableau Developer Program](https://www.tableau.com/developer), which grants you a personal Tableau Cloud sandbox. 

### Generate a Personal Access Token 

<Steps>
<Step>
Sign into Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the menu bar at the top of the page, click your profile image or initials and select **My Account Settings** from the menu. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Personal Access Tokens** area of the page, enter a name for your new token (such as "ConductorOne integration") and then click **Create**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the newly generated token and its name. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Locate your server path and site ID

<Steps>
<Step>
Locate your server path, which is the base URL for your Tableau server. 
</Step>
<Step>
Locate your site ID, which is the value that appears after `/site/` in the full URL for your Tableau instance. 

Examples: 

For a Tableau Server instance with the URL `http://SampleServer#/site/SecurityTeam/projects`, the server path is `SampleServer` and the site ID is `SecurityTeam`. 

For a Tableau Cloud instance with the URL `https://10ay.online.tableau.com#/site/MarketingTeam/workbooks`, the server path is `10ay.online.tableau.com` and the site ID is `MarketingTeam`. 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configure the Tableau connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Tableau credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Tableau** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Tableau connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the site ID and server path into the **Site ID** and **Server path** fields.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the name of the personal access token into the **Access token name** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the personal access token value into the **Access token secret** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Tableau connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Tableau](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-tableau) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Tableau connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Tableau connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Tableau connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-tableau-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-tableau-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Tableau credentials
  BATON_ACCESS_TOKEN_NAME: <Name of the Tableau access token>
  BATON_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: <Tableau access token>
  BATON_SERVER_PATH: <Base URL for your Tableau server>
  BATON_SITE_ID: <Tableau site ID>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-tableau.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-tableau
  labels:
    app: baton-tableau
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-tableau
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-tableau
        baton: true
        baton-app: tableau
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-tableau
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-tableau:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-tableau
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-tableau-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Tableau connector to. Tableau data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Tableau connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
