## Gather Redis credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Redis. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

To set up the integration with ConductorOne, you'll need: 

- Your Redis Enterprise Service cluster host and port 

- The username and password for a Redis user (or service account) with admin permissions

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Redis connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Redis credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Redis Enterprise** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Redis connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Cluster host** field, enter your Redis Enterprise Service cluster host. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **API port** field, enter the enterprise API port (defaults to `9443`).
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Username** and **Password** fields, enter the login credentials for a Redis user with admin permissions. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Redis connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Redis connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Redis connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Redis connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Redis connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-redis-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-redis-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Redis credentials
  BATON_CLUSTER_HOST: <The cluster host for your Redis Enterprise Service>
  BATON_API_PORT: <The Redis Enterprise admin port (defaults to 9443)>
  BATON_USERNAME: <Redis account username>
  BATON_PASSWORD: <Redis account password>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-redis.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-redis
  labels:
    app: baton-redis
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-redis
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-redis
        baton: true
        baton-app: redis
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-redis
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-redis:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-redis
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-redis-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
1. Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Redis connector to. Redis data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Redis connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
