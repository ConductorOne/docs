## Capabilities

| Resource     | Sync | Provision |

| Accounts     | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>   |  <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>           |       
| Scopes     | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>    |  <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>         | 
| Subusers     | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>    |           | 

The SendGrid connector supports [automatic account provisioning and deprovisioning](/docs/product/admin/account-provisioning). 

New accounts are invited by email with optional scopes and admin permissions:

* `is_admin`: Whether the teammate has admin privileges (default: false). 
* `scopes`: List of permission scopes for non-admin teammates (default: "user.profile.read"). Scopes are ignored when `is_admin` is true, as admins have full access.

## Gather SendGrid credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in SendGrid. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

### Create a SendGrid API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In SendGrid, navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create API Key**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give your API key a name, such as "ConductorOne integration".
</Step>
<Step>
Select **Full Access**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create & View**.
</Step>
<Step>
The new API key is created. Carefully copy and save the API key. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the SendGrid connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of SendGrid credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **SendGrid** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new SendGrid connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste your API key into the **API key** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your SendGrid connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [SendGrid connector](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-sendgrid) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new SendGrid connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new SendGrid connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your SendGrid connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-sendgrid-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-sendgrid-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # SendGrid-specific credentials
  BATON_SENDGRID_API_KEY: <SendGrid API key>
  BATON_SENDGRID_REGION: <SendGrid service region (defaults to global)>

  # Optional: include if you want to skip syncing SendGrid subusers
  BATON_IGNORE_SUBUSERS: <true>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-sendgrid.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-sendgrid
  labels:
    app: baton-sendgrid
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-sendgrid
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-sendgrid
        baton: true
        baton-app: sendgrid
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-sendgrid
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-sendgrid:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-sendgrid
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-sendgrid-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the SendGrid connector to. SendGrid data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your SendGrid connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
