## Gather JumpCloud credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in JumpCloud. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with an **Administrator** identity in JumpCloud on the relevant JumpCloud org must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Retrieve a JumpCloud API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In JumpCloud, log in as an Administrator.
</Step>
<Step>
Click your user avatar at the top right corner of the page and click **My API Key**.
</Step>
<Step>
Copy the API key.
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the JumpCloud connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of JumpCloud credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **JumpCloud** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new JumpCloud connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your JumpCloud connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [JumpCloud](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-jumpcloud) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new JumpCloud connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new JumpCloud connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your JumpCloud connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-jumpcloud-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-jumpcloud-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # JumpCloud credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <JumpCloud API key>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-jumpcloud.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-jumpcloud
  labels:
    app: baton-jumpcloud
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-jumpcloud
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-jumpcloud
        baton: true
        baton-app: jumpcloud
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-jumpcloud
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-jumpcloud:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-jumpcloud
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-jumpcloud-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the JumpCloud connector to. JumpCloud data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your JumpCloud connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### What's next?

If JumpCloud is your company's identity provider (meaning that it is used to SSO into other software), the connector sync will automatically create applications in ConductorOne for all of your SCIMed software. Before you move on, review the [Create applications](/product/admin/applications) page for important information about how to set up connectors for the SCIMed apps.

## Troubleshooting the JumpCloud integration

### Why do I see multiple accounts for some JumpCloud users?

JumpCloud separates users and admin users, giving each a separate identity and login. Because of this, a user who is both a user and an admin user in JumpCloud will have two JumpCloud accounts in ConductorOne.

### Why don't I see profile attributes listed for a JumpCloud admin user?

An admin user in JumpCloud is intended only to manage the JumpCloud tenant, and not to be an identity that gains access to resources. Because of this design, admin users are not associated with the profile attributes, such as department or job title, that are associated with a non-admin user account.
