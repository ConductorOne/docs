The Zoom connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Zoom.

## Gather Zoom credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Zoom. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with **Account Owner** status in Zoom must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a Zoom OAuth app

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/). 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Develop** and select **Build App**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Locate the **Server-to-Server OAuth** option and click **Create**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give your app a name, such as "ConductorOne" and click **Create**. 
</Step>
<Step>
A page for the newly created app opens. Copy and save the Account ID, Client ID, and Client secret shown on this page.  
</Step>
</Steps>

### Configure and activate the OAuth app
<Steps>
<Step>
From the **App Credentials** page, click **Continue**. 
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Basic information** page, fill out the form and click **Continue**. 
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Feature** page, do not make any changes. Click **Continue**. 
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Scopes** page, click **+ Add Scopes**. Give the app the following set of scopes: 

   - contact_group:read:list_groups:admin
   - group:read:list_groups:admin
   - group:read:list_members:admin
   - group:read:administrator:admin
   - role:read:list_roles:admin
   - role:read:list_members:admin
   - user:read:user:admin
   - user:read:list_users:admin

   If you want to use ConductorOne to provision and deprovision Zoom permissions, add these scopes as well:

   - role:write:member:admin
   - role:delete:member:admin
   - group:write:member:admin
   - group:delete:member:admin
   - user:write:user:admin
   - group:write:administrator:admin
   - group:delete:administrator:admin
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Done**. Review the list of scopes and click **Continue**. 
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Activation** page, click **Activate your app**. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Zoom connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Zoom credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Zoom** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Zoom connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the account ID for the new app into the **Account ID** fields.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the Client ID and Client secret into the **Client ID** and **Client secret** fields.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Zoom connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Zoom](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-zoom) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-zoom): Access the source code, report issues, or contribute to the project.

### Step 1: Set up a new Zoom connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Zoom connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Zoom connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-zoom-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-zoom-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Zoom credentials
  BATON_ACCOUNT_ID: <Zoom app account ID>
  BATON_ZOOM_CLIENT_ID: <Zoom client ID>
  BATON_ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET: <Zoom client secret>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-zoom.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-zoom
  labels:
    app: baton-zoom
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-zoom
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-zoom
        baton: true
        baton-app: zoom
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-zoom
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-zoom:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-zoom
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-zoom-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Zoom connector to. Zoom data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Zoom connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
