## Availability

ConductorOne currently only integrates with Snyk Enterprise. ConductorOne can only integrate with Snyk editions that include API access. You cannot use this connector successfully with the Free or Team editions of Snyk.

## Gather Snyk credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Snyk. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with access to a service or user account in Snyk with **Group Admin** permissions on the Group you're integrating must perform this task. 

If you want to provision invitations using ConductorOne, the account used to generate the API token must also have the `org.read`, `org.user.read`, and `org.user.invite` permissions.
</Warning>

### Look up your account's Snyk API token

<Steps>
<Step>
In Snyk, navigate to the **Account Settings** page.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **General**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **KEY** field, click to display the account API token.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the API token. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Look up your Snyk Group ID

<Steps>
<Step>
In Snyk, navigate to the group **Settings** page and click **General**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Group ID** section of the page, carefully copy and save the group ID. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Snyk connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Snyk credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Snyk** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Snyk connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the Group ID into the **Group ID** field.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you want ConductorOne to only sync access data from specific Snyk organizations, enter the organization names in the **Org IDs** field. 

   If you leave this field blank, ConductorOne will sync data from all organizations.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** The connector uses `api.snyk.io` (region SNYK-US-01) by default. If your Snyk instance is hosted in any other region, please specify your hostname in the **Hostname** field.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you want the connector to sync and provision Snyk invitations, check **Enable invitations**. 

This feature requires the `org.read`, `org.user.read`, and `org.user.invite` permissions on the account used to generate the API key entered above.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Snyk connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Snyk](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-snyk) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Resources

* [Official download center](https://dist.conductorone.com/ConductorOne/baton-snyk): For stable binaries (Windows/Linux/macOS) and container images.

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-snyk): Access the source code, report issues, or contribute to the project.

### Step 1: Set up a new Snyk connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Snyk connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Snyk connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-snyk-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-snyk-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Snyk credentials
  BATON_API_TOKEN: <Snyk API token>
  BATON_GROUP_ID: <Snyk group ID>
  BATON_ORG_IDS: <Limit syncing to only the specified Snyk organizations (optional)>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: include if your Snyk instance is hosted in a region other than SNYK-US-01
  BATON_SNYK_HOST_NAME: <Snyk region hostname (defaults to "api.snyk.io")>

  # Optional: include if you want to sync and provision invitations
  BATON_ENABLE_INVITATIONS: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-snyk.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-snyk
  labels:
    app: baton-snyk
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-snyk
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-snyk
        baton: true
        baton-app: snyk
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-snyk
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-snyk:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-snyk
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-snyk-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Snyk connector to. Snyk data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Snyk connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
