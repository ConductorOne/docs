## Gather SentinelOne credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in SentinelOne. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with access to the SentinelOne management console must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate a SentinelOne API token

<Steps>
<Step>
In the SentinelOne management console, click your username and select **My user**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Actions** > **API Token Operations** > **Generate API Token**.
</Step>
<Step>
The API token is created. Carefully copy and save the token. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the SentinelOne connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of SentinelOne credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **SentinelOne** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new SentinelOne connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **SentinelOne base URL** field, enter the base URL of your SentinelOne instance. 

   The base URL is in the form `https://acmeco.sentinelone.net`. 
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API token into the **API token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your SentinelOne connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [SentinelOne](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-sentinel-one) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new SentinelOne connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new SentinelOne connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your SentinelOne connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-sentinel-one-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-sentinel-one-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # SentinelOne credentials
  BATON_API_TOKEN: <SentinelOne API token>
  BATON_MANAGEMENT_CONSOLE_URL: <Base URL of your SentinelOne instance in the form https://acmeco.sentinelone.net>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-sentinel-one.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-sentinel-one
  labels:
    app: baton-sentinel-one
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-sentinel-one
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-sentinel-one
        baton: true
        baton-app: sentinel-one
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-sentinel-one
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-sentinel-one:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-sentinel-one
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-sentinel-one-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the SentinelOne connector to. SentinelOne data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your SentinelOne connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
