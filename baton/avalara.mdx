## Gather Avalara credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Avalara. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    The credentials for either your Avalara account, or for a [service account you've set up in Avalara](https://knowledge.avalara.com/bundle/frz1659702260835_frz1659702260835/page/Add_a_user_and_set_permissions.html).
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The URL of your Avalara tenant (sandbox and production environments are both accepted).
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Avalara connector

<Warning>
**To complete this task, you'll need:**

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Avalara credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Avalara** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Avalara connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Username** and **Password** fields, enter the credentials for either your Avalara account, or for a [service account you've set up in Avalara](https://knowledge.avalara.com/bundle/frz1659702260835_frz1659702260835/page/Add_a_user_and_set_permissions.html).
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Environment** field, enter the URL of your Avalara tenant (sandbox and production environments are both accepted).
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Avalara connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Avalara connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Avalara connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Avalara connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.
	Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Avalara connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-avalara-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-avalara-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Avalara credentials
  BATON_ENVIRONMENT: <URL of the Avalara environment to connect to (either production or sandbox)>
  BATON_PASSWORD: <password to the Avalara account>
  BATON_USERNAME: <username for the Avalara account>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-avalara.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-avalara
  labels:
    app: baton-avalara
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-avalara
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-avalara
        baton: true
        baton-app: avalara
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-avalara
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-avalara:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-avalara
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-avalara-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Avalara connector to. Avalara data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Avalara connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
