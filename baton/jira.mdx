The Jira Cloud connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Jira.

<Icon icon="circle-info" /> This connector can be configured to sync app accounts from the Jira API and managed accounts and managed groups from Atlassian.

This connector can also be configured to automatically create and update Jira tickets to track manual provisioning assignments. Go to [Configure Jira Cloud as an external ticketing provider](/product/admin/external-ticketing#configure-jira-cloud-as-an-external-ticketing-provider) to learn more.

## Known limitations

- User email is not currently synchronized
- Only lists the first 1,000 users of a project

## Gather Jira Cloud credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Jira Cloud. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
**Important**

The Jira Cloud user account used to generate these credentials must have the following permissions:

- View users, groups, and projects
- View project roles
- Manage group memberships (required if you are using the connector for provisioning)
- Manage project role memberships (required if you are using the connector for provisioning)
- Create issues (required if you are using the connector as an external ticketing provider)
</Warning>

### Create an API token

You can set up the connector using either a classic (unscoped) or a scoped token. 

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Log into your Jira account with Administrator access.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Navigate to [https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Create API token**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Give your token a label, such as **ConductorOne**, and click **Create**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Carefully copy and save the newly generated API token.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Additional credentials

To set up the connector, you'll also need:

* If using a classic token, your Jira Cloud URL in `https://your-domain.atlassian.net` format

* If using a scoped token, your cloud ID, which can be found at `https://<your-domain>.atlassian.net/_edge/tenant_info`

* The email address for your Jira Cloud account

### Optional: Create an Atlassian organization API key

If you want to set up the Jira Cloud connector to sync managed accounts and managed groups from Atlassian, you'll need to generate an Atlassian API token and look up your [Atlassian organization ID](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/retrieve-my-atlassian-cloud-organization-s-id-1207189876.html).

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Log into [your Atlassian account](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) and select your organization, if relevant.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Navigate to **Settings** > **API keys**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Create API key**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Select **API key without scopes**, then click **Create API key**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Review the key info and click **Create**. The new organization API key is generated.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Carefully copy and save the **API key** and the **organization ID**.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Resources

* [Official download center](https://dist.conductorone.com/ConductorOne/baton-jira): For stable binaries (Windows/Linux/macOS) and container images.

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-jira): Access the source code, report issues, or contribute to the project.

### Step 1: Set up a new Jira Cloud connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Jira Cloud connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>

    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.
	Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Jira Cloud connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-jira-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-jira-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Jira Cloud credentials
  BATON_JIRA_URL: <Jira Cloud tenant URL in https://domain.atlassian.net format (unscoped token) or https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloud-id> format (scoped token)>
  BATON_JIRA_API_TOKEN: <Jira Cloud API token>
  BATON_JIRA_EMAIL: <Email address associated with your Jira Cloud account>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to skip syncing customer users
  BATON_SKIP_CUSTOMER_USER: true

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to skip syncing project participants
  BATON_SKIP_PROJECT_PARTICIPANTS: true

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to sync managed accounts and managed groups from Atlassian 
  BATON_ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN: <Atlassian API token>
  BATON_ATLASSIAN_ORGID: <Atlassian organization ID>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-jira.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-jira
  labels:
    app: baton-jira
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-jira
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-jira
        baton: true
        baton-app: jira
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-jira
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-jira:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-jira
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-jira-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Jira Cloud connector to. Jira Cloud data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Jira Cloud connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
