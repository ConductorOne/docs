## Gather Jamf credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Jamf. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user the **Administrator** role in Jamf Pro must perform this task.
</Warning>

### (Optional) Create a service account

The ConductorOne Jamf Pro connector requires a username and password. If desired, you can set up a service account to be used for the connector.

<Steps>
<Step>
Follow the instructions in the Jamf documentation for [Creating a Jamf Pro User Account](https://learn.jamf.com/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/Jamf_Pro_User_Accounts_and_Groups.html#ariaid-title3)
</Step>
<Step>
Give the user you create full access to the Jamf Pro instance and the Administrator privilege set.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Jamf connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Jamf credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Jamf** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Jamf connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Instance URL** field, enter the URL of your Jamf Pro instance.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the username of the service account you created (or the username of a Jamf Pro user with Administrator permissions) into the **Username** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the password associated with the username into the **Password** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Jamf connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Jamf connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Jamf connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Jamf connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Jamf connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-jamf-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-jamf-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Jamf credentials
  BATON_INSTANCE_URL: <URL of your Jamf Pro instance>
  BATON_PASSWORD: <Password to the Jamf Pro account>
  BATON_USERNAME: <Username for the Jamf Pro account>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-jamf.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-jamf
  labels:
    app: baton-jamf
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-jamf
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-jamf
        baton: true
        baton-app: jamf
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-jamf
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-jamf:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-jamf
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-jamf-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Jamf connector to. Jamf data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Jamf connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
