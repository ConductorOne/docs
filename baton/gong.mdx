<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.

## Gather Gong configuration information

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in information from Gong. Gather these configuration details before you move on.

Here's the information you'll need:

- Access Key
- Base URL
- Secret Key

See the Gong docs for information on how to acquire credentials: [View the documentation](https://help.gong.io/docs/receive-access-to-the-api)

This connector requires the following scopes:

  - api:users:read
  - api:workspaces:read

## Configure the Gong connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Gong configuration information gathered by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Gong** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Gong connector:

    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

    - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the configuration information from the previous section.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Gong connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Gong connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Resources 

[Contact ConductorOne's support team](mailto:support@conductorone.com) to download the latest version of the connector.

### Step 1: Set up a new Gong connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Gong connector:

    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

    - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Gong connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-gong-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-gong-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>

  # Gong config
  BATON_GONG_ACCESS_KEY: <Access key for Gong API>
  BATON_GONG_BASE_URL: <Base URL for Gong API (e.g. https://SOMETHING.api.gong.io)>
  BATON_GONG_SECRET_KEY: <Secret key for Gong API>

```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-gong.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-gong
  labels:
    app: baton-gong
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-gong
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-gong
        baton: true
        baton-app: gong
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-gong
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-gong:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-gong
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-gong-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the gong connector to. gong data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Gong connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
