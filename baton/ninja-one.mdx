<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Gather NinjaOne configuration information

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in information from NinjaOne. Gather these configuration details before you move on.

Here's the information you'll need:

- NinjaOne Base URL
- NinjaOne Client ID
- NinjaOne Client Secret
- NinjaOne Scope

<Warning>
A user with the **Admin** role in NinjaOne must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a NinjaOne application

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into NinjaOne and navigate to Configuration > Apps > API > Client App IDs.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select **API Services (machine-to-machine)** as the application platform.

    This creates an M2M app suitable for the Client Credentials Flow used by this connector.
</Step>
<Step>
Configure the application's settings:

    - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Baton NinjaOne Connector")
    - **Redirect URIs**: Leave empty (not needed for M2M applications)
    - **Scopes**: Select the required scopes (see below)
    - **Allowed Grant Types**: Ensure "Client Credentials" is enabled

    Give the application the relevant set of scopes:

    For Syncing (Read-Only Operations):

    - **monitoring** - Required to read user information and organizational structure
    - **management** - Required to read role definitions and user-role assignments

    For Provisioning (Read-Write Operations):

    - **monitoring** - Required to read user information and organizational structure
    - **management** - Required to create/delete users and manage user information
    - **control** - Required to manage role assignments and user permissions
</Step>
<Step>
After saving, carefully copy and save the client ID and client secret.
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the NinjaOne connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of NinjaOne configuration information gathered by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **NinjaOne** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new NinjaOne connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the configuration information from the previous section.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your NinjaOne connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the NinjaOne connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new NinjaOne connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new NinjaOne connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your NinjaOne connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-ninja-one-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-ninja-one-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>

  # NinjaOne config
  BATON_NINJA_ONE_BASE_URL: <Base URL for your NinjaOne instance (e.g., https://app.ninjarmm.com)>
  BATON_NINJA_ONE_CLIENT_ID: <OAuth2 Client ID for NinjaOne API>
  BATON_NINJA_ONE_CLIENT_SECRET: <OAuth2 Client Secret for NinjaOne API>
  BATON_NINJA_ONE_SCOPE: <OAuth2 Scope for NinjaOne API>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-ninja-one.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-ninja-one
  labels:
    app: baton-ninja-one
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-ninja-one
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-ninja-one
        baton: true
        baton-app: ninja-one
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-ninja-one
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-ninja-one:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-ninja-one
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-ninja-one-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the ninja-one connector to. ninja-one data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your NinjaOne connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
