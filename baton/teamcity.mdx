The TeamCity connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in TeamCity.

## Gather TeamCity credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in TeamCity. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **System administrator** role in TeamCity must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate an access token

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into TeamCity and navigate to **Access Tokens** in your user profile.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create access token**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the token a name, such as "ConductorOne".
</Step>
<Step>
Set the **Permission scope** to **Same as current user**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create**. The new token is generated.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the access token.
</Step>
</Steps>


**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.  

## Configure the TeamCity connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of TeamCity credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **TeamCity** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new TeamCity connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste your access token in the **TeamCity access token** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your **TeamCity instance URL** in the next field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your TeamCity connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [TeamCity](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-teamcity) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Resources 

Contact ConductorOne's support team](mailto:support@conductorone.com) to download the latest version of the connector.

### Step 1: Configure the TeamCity connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new TeamCity connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your TeamCity connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-teamcity-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-teamcity-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # TeamCity credentials
  BATON_ACCESS_TOKEN: <TeamCity access token>
  BATON_INSTANCE_URL: <TeamCity instance URL>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-teamcity.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-teamcity
  labels:
    app: baton-teamcity
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-teamcity
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-teamcity
        baton: true
        baton-app: teamcity
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-teamcity
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-teamcity:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-teamcity
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-teamcity-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the TeamCity connector to. TeamCity data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your TeamCity connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
