## Gather PrismHR credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in PrismHR. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with Back Office menu access in PrismHR must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a PrismHR web service user 

The Web Service User you create must be able to call the following Methods (or Endpoints): 

* ClientService.getClientCodes (The "Location", "Department", "Status", "Job", and "PositionClass" options must be allowed) 
* ClientService.getClientList 
* ClientService.getClientMaster 
* EmployeeService.getEmployee (The "Person" and "Client" options must be allowed)
* EmployeeService.getEmployeeList 
* EmployeeService.getManagerApproverName 
* LoginService.createPeoSession 
* PrismSecurityService.getEmployeeClientList

<Steps>
<Step>
In the PrismHR Back Office menu, navigate to **System|Change** > **System Parameters**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **Actions** menu and select **Web Service User**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a **User ID**. If a PrismHR user account is associated with this web service user, make sure both user IDs are the same.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a **User Name**. This can be the same as the user ID.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a **Password**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter any **Contact Information** for this user.
</Step>
<Step>
If you need to restrict access to certain clients, methods, or IP addresses, use the other fields on the form to configure this. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. Make a note of the web service user's username, password, and PeoID. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the PrismHR connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of PrismHR credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **PrismHR** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new PrismHR connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the Base URL of the PrismHR API (ends with `/services/rest`) in the **PrismHR instance URL** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the PrismHR web service user's credentials into the **Username**, **Password**, and **PeoID** fields.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your PrismHR connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [PrismHR](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-prismhr) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new PrismHR connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new PrismHR connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your PrismHR connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-prismhr-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-prismhr-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>

  # PrismHR specific credentials
  BATON_INSTANCE_URL: <Base URL of the PrismHR API to connect to (ends with /services/rest)>
  BATON_USERNAME: <PrismHR web service user username>
  BATON_PASSWORD: <PrismHR web service user password>
  BATON_PEOID: <PrismHR web service user PeoID>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-prismhr.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-prismhr
  labels:
    app: baton-prismhr
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-prismhr
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-prismhr
        baton: true
        baton-app: prismhr
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-prismhr
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-prismhr:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-prismhr
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-prismhr-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the PrismHR connector to. PrismHR data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your PrismHR connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
