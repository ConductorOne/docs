<Tip>
**This is an updated and improved version of the Twingate connector!** If you're setting up Twingate with ConductorOne for the first time, you're in the right place.

## Gather Twingate credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Twingate. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Admin** role in Twingate must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate a new API key

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into Twingate as an Admin user and click **Settings**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **API**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate Token**. Give the API token a label, such as **ConductorOne**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the appropriate permission level for the API key:

   - **Read only** to run access reviews on your Twingate users.
   - **Read & Write** to provision group membership via ConductorOne and run access reviews.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate**. (Setting the Allowed Range is not required.)
</Step>
<Step>
The new API key is generated for you. Click **Copy** and save the key.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Twingate connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Twingate credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Twingate** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Twingate connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key you into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Domain** field, enter your Twingate domain.

   For example, if your Twingate instance address is `sampledomain.twingate.com`, enter **sampledomain** in the **Domain** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Twingate connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Twingate](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-twingate) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Twingate connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Twingate connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Twingate connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-twingate-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-twingate-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Twingate credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <Twingate API key>
  BATON_DOMAIN: <Twingate domain, such as "sampledomain" if you access Twongate at "sampledomain.twingate.com">

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-twingate.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-twingate
  labels:
    app: baton-twingate
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-twingate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-twingate
        baton: true
        baton-app: twingate
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-twingate
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-twingate:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-twingate-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Twingate connector to. Twingate data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Twingate connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
