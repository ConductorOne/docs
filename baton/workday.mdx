## Which Workday connector should I use? 

ConductorOne offers two Workday connectors: Workday and Workday Accounts (WQL). How you want to work with Workday in ConductorOne will determine which one you should set up.

* **[Workday connector](/baton/workday)**: This connector is the best choice if you want to use Workday as a [directory](/product/admin/directory). You’ll also need it if you want to enable access requests for Workday role and group assignments. 

* **[Workday Account (WQL) connector](/baton/workday-wql)**: This connector utilizes the Workday Query Language (WQL), which allows it to pull a different data set than the Workday connector. Workday Accounts (WQL) is the best choice if you want to review who has what kind of access to Workday in your organization, including account type and service center assignments. 

| Resource                                          | Workday connector\* | Workday Accounts (WQL) connector |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Accounts                                          | Sync                | Sync                             |
| Roles                                             | Sync                |                                  |
| Security groups                                   | Sync                | Sync                             |
| Account type (Implementers and Integration Users) |                     | Sync                             |
| Service centers                                   |                     | Sync                             |

*If the Workday connector is configured using a custom report (see below), it can also pull in information on the account owner’s organization, title, and manager.

| Security groups | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/>    |       | 

## Gather Workday credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Workday. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Tip>
To authenticate with Workday, you can use either an **API client** or a Report-as-a-service (RaaS) **custom report** in CSV or JSON format. 

**Which authentication method should I use?**
The **API client option** pulls available data about Workday accounts, such as each account's manager and manager email, which can be used as [user attributes](/product/admin/attributes). The custom report method only pulls data that is explicitly named in the report into ConductorOne. 

The **RaaS custom report option** is often preferred by Workday Admins and HR teams, as it’s Workday’s preferred integration method. RaaS allows you fine-grained control over what data is sent to ConductorOne. Additionally, it allows you to transform the format of Workday attributes as needed before sending them to ConductorOne.

Follow the relevant set of instructions below to generate your credentials.
</Tip>

### Option 1: Authenticate using API client credentials

Here's the reorganized documentation, with the ISU creation step added in the correct sequence, and the security group assignment moved to be with the ISU creation.

### Create Workday API Client Credentials

<Warning>
A user with the permission to create a new API client in Workday must perform this task.
</Warning>

The process involves creating an Integration System User (ISU), creating a security group, associating the ISU with the security group, and then registering the API client and generating a refresh token.

#### Create an Integration System User (ISU)

<Steps>
<Step>
In Workday, use the search bar to look up "Create Integration System User".

</Step>
<Step>
In the **Create Integration System User** modal, enter a **User Name**, such as "ConductorOne integration". 
</Step>
<Step>

Enter and confirm a strong **Password** for this user.

   Optionally, you can provide a **New Password Never Expires** if appropriate for your security policies.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **OK**.
</Step>
<Step>
Make note of the **User Name** you created, as you will need it later.
</Step>
</Steps>
#### Create a new Security Group

<Steps>
<Step>
In Workday, use the search bar to look up "Maintain Permissions for Security Group".
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Maintain Permissions for Security Group** modal, make sure the **Maintain** button is selected.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Source Security Group** field, navigate to **By Type** > **Integration System Security Group**.
</Step>
<Step>
Create a new security group. Give it a name, such as "ConductorOne integration security group".
</Step>
<Step>
On the new group's **Domain Security Policy Permissions** tab, leave the **Select All** box checked.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **+** icon to create six (or seven, see below) new rows, and fill them out as follows:

    Row 1:

    * View/Modify Access: **View Only**
    * Domain Security Policy: **Worker Data: Public Worker Reports**

    Row 2:

    * View/Modify Access: **View Only**
    * Domain Security Policy: **Reports: Organization**

    Row 3:

    * View/Modify Access: **View Only**
    * Domain Security Policy: **Security Administration**

    Row 4:

    * View/Modify Access: **View Only**
    * Domain Security Policy: **Manager: Organization Roles**

    Row 5:

    * View/Modify Access: **View Only**
    * Domain Security Policy: **Person Data: Work Email**

    Row 6:

    * View/Modify Access: **View Only**
    * Domain Security Policy: **Worker Data: Current Staffing Information**

    Row 7 (needed only if title data is split out from the inherent staffing parent domain):

    * View/Modify Access: **View Only**
    * Domain Security Policy: **Worker Data: Staffing Business Title**
</Step>
<Step>
Click **OK**.
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Assign the Security Group to the Integration System User (ISU)

<Steps>
<Step>
Still in Workday, use the search bar to look up "View Workday Account" and select the **Integration System User (ISU)** you created previously.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the three dots icon next to the account name and navigate to **Security Profile** > **Assign Integration System Security Groups**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the security group you created and click **OK**.
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Activate Security Policy Changes

<Steps>
<Step>
Next, activate the security policy changes. Search for "Activate Pending Security Policy Changes".
</Step>
<Step>
Add a comment about the change you're making and click **OK**.
</Step>
<Step>
Review the changes and if everything looks good, click the **Confirm** checkbox, then click **OK**.
</Step>
</Steps>
#### Create a New Workday API Client

<Steps>
<Step>
In Workday, use the search bar to look up "Register API Client for Integrations". Make sure to select this name from the results, not the similarly named "Register API Client".
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new API client a name, such as "ConductorOne integration".
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Integration System User** field, select the ISU you created earlier. This is crucial for associating the API client with the correct permissions.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Scopes** box, select **Custom Objects** and search for "Staffing". Select **Staffing** and **Organizations and Roles** and click **OK**.
</Step>
<Step>
The newly created client's client ID and client secret are shown. Carefully copy and save these credentials.

    **Do not** click **Done** at the bottom of the page yet.
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Create a Refresh Token

<Steps>
<Step>
Next, click the three dots icon next to the client name and navigate to **API Client** > **Manage Refresh Tokens for Integrations**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the **Integration System User (ISU)** you want to associate with the token (this should be the same ISU you selected when registering the API client) and click **OK**.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Delete or Regenerate Refresh Token** page, scroll down and check the **Generate New Refresh Token** box.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **OK**.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the new refresh token.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

### Option 2: Authenticate using a custom report 

<Warning>
A user with the permission to create a custom report in Workday must perform this task.
</Warning>

#### Set up the custom report

<Steps>
<Step>
In Workday, navigate to the **Tasks and Reports** menu and select **Create Custom Report**. 
</Step>
<Step>
When setting report details, set the report type to **Advanced** and mark **Enable As Web Service**. 
</Step>
<Step>
When setting data sources, disable the **Optimized for Performance** option and select **All Workers** as the data source. 
</Step>
</Steps>

At this point, you can create the custom report in either JSON (recommended) or CSV format by following the relevant directions below. 

### Expected custom report contents when using the JSON format

When using the JSON format for custom reports, the connector expects a specific structure. Below is a table of the supported fields:

**Suggested Data Source:** All Active and Terminated Workers
