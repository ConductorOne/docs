<Tip>
**This is an updated and improved version of the Cloudflare connector!** If you're setting up Cloudflare with ConductorOne for the first time, you're in the right place.

## Gather Cloudflare credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Cloudflare. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with **Super Administrator** access in Cloudflare must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Locate your Cloudflare Account ID

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In the Cloudflare dashboard, navigate to **Account home**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Open the menu at the end of the account row and select **Copy account ID**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Copy and save the Account ID.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create an API token

<Tip>
If you prefer to authenticate to Cloudflare using the legacy Global API key rather than an API token, follow the [Get Global API key (legacy)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/keys/) instructions in the Cloudflare documentation.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Click the user icon and select **My Profile**

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/assets/cloudflare-2.png" alt="" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **API Tokens** on the left side, then click **Create Token**.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/assets/cloudflare-3.png" alt="" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step>
  At the bottom of the page, in the **Custom Token** area, click **Get started**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Fill out the **Create Custom Token** page as follows:

    1. Give the API token a name, such as **ConductorOne**

    2. Set the appropriate permissions for the API token:

       - To provision Cloudflare access via ConductorOne and run access reviews on your Cloudflare users:

         - Account -> Account Settings -> Edit

         - Account -> Access: Organizations, Identity Providers, and Groups -> Read

       - To only run access reviews on your Cloudflare users:

         - Account -> Account Settings -> Read

         - Account -> Access: Organizations, Identity Providers, and Groups -> Read

    3. Click **Continue to summary**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Create Token** and carefully copy and save the token generated for you.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/assets/cloudflare-6.png" alt="" />
  </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** You should now have one of the following credentials sets:

* Account ID
* API token

OR

* Account ID
* The email address associated with your Cloudflare account
* Global API key

Next, move on to the instructions for your chosen setup method.

## Configure the Cloudflare connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Cloudflare credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Cloudflare v2** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Cloudflare connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

    If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how you'll authenticate to Cloudflare:
    - Select **API token**, then enter the account ID into the **Account ID** field and paste the API token into the **API token** field.
    - Select **Email + API key**, then enter the account ID into the **Account ID** field, your email into the **Email ID** field, and your Global API key into the **API key** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Cloudflare connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Cloudflare](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-cloudflare) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Cloudflare connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Cloudflare connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

    If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

    Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Cloudflare connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-cloudflare-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-cloudflare-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Cloudflare credentials, option 1
  BATON_ACCOUNT_ID: <Cloudflare account ID>
  BATON_API_TOKEN: <Cloudflare API token>

  # Cloudflare credentials, option 2
  BATON_ACCOUNT_ID: <Cloudflare account ID>
  BATON_API_KEY: <Cloudflare global API key>
  BATON_EMAIL_ID: <Email address for your Cloudflare account>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-cloudflare.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-cloudflare
  labels:
    app: baton-cloudflare
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-cloudflare
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-cloudflare
        baton: true
        baton-app: cloudflare
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-cloudflare
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-cloudflare:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-cloudflare
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-cloudflare-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Cloudflare connector to. Cloudflare data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Cloudflare connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
