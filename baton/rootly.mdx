[This connector can sync secrets](/product/admin/inventory) and display them on the **Inventory** page. 

## Gather Rootly credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Rootly. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with permission to create API keys in Rootly must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create new Rootly roles

<Steps>
<Step>
In Rootly, navigate to **Configuration** > **Roles and permissions** > **Configuration**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create role**. 
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Incident Response** tab, click **Custom Roles** > **Create Role**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Set the **Teams:Read** and **Secrets:Read** permissions, then click **Create**. 
</Step>
<Step>
On the **On-Call** tab, click **Custom Roles** > **Create Role**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Set the **Teams Permissions:Read** and **Schedules Permissions:Read** permissions, then click **Create**. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Create a Rootly API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In Rootly, navigate to **Configuration** > **API Keys**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate New API Key**. 
</Step>
<Step>
When prompted to select an API key type, select **Global API Key**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new API key the incident response and on-call roles you created above. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new key a name, such as "ConductorOne", and a description, then set an expiration. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the new API key. 
</Step>
</Steps>

Note that if you ever edit a Rootly role used on an API key, the existing key will not receive changes to the role permissions. You must generate a new API key. 
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Rootly connector
<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:
- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Rootly credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Rootly** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Rootly connector: 
   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Rootly connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Rootly](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-rootly) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Rootly connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Rootly connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Rootly connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-rootly-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-rootly-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Rootly credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <Rootly API key>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-rootly.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-rootly
  labels:
    app: baton-rootly
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-rootly
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-rootly
        baton: true
        baton-app: rootly
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-rootly
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-rootly:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-rootly
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-rootly-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Rootly connector to. Rootly data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Rootly connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
