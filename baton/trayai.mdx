The Tray.ai connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning). 

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Tray.ai.

## Gather Tray.ai credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Tray.ai. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Organization Admin** role in in Tray.ai must perform this task. 
</Warning>

### Create a new API user and generate an API token

<Steps>
<Step>
In Tray.ai, navigate to **Account Settings** > **Tokens** and click **Create API user**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new API user a name, such as "ConductorOne" and select the relevant workspace.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Organization role** and **Workspace role** fields, select **Viewer** to give ConductorOne read-only (sync) permissions, or **Contributor** to give ConductorOne read/write (sync and provision) permissions. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a name for the API token, such as "ConductorOne token" and set its expiration. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the API token. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Tray.ai connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Tray.ai credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Tray.ai** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Tray.ai connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 
</Step>
<Step>

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API token into the **Authentication token** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Tray.ai connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Tray.ai](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-trayai) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**  

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the Tray.ai connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Tray.ai connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Tray.ai connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-trayai-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-trayai-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Tray.ai credentials
  BATON_AUTH_TOKEN: <Tray.ai API token>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-trayai.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-trayai
  labels:
    app: baton-trayai
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-trayai
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-trayai
        baton: true
        baton-app: trayai
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-trayai
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-trayai:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-trayai
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-trayai-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Tray.ai connector to. Tray.ai data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Tray.ai connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
