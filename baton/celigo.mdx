## Gather Celigo credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Celigo. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with the **Account owner** or **Administrator** role in Celigo must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate a Celigo API token

<Steps>
<Step>
In Celigo, navigate to **Resources** > **API tokens**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create API token**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new API token a name, such as "ConductorOne integration".
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Auto purge token** field, select a lifetime for the token.
</Step>
<Step>
Set the token's scope to **Full access**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save & close**.
</Step>
<Step>
The new token is shown on the **API tokens** page. Click **Show token** to view the full token value.
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully and copy and save the new API token.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Celigo connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Celigo credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Celigo** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Celigo connector:
  - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
  - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
  - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select your Celigo region (United States or European Union).
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API token you generated in Step 1 into the **Access token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Celigo connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Celigo](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-celigo) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Celigo connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Celigo connector:
  - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
  - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
  - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Celigo connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-celigo-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-celigo-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Celigo credentials
  BATON_CELIGO_ACCESS_TOKEN: <API access token generated for this integration>
  BATON_REGION: <Your Celigo region (default "us")>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-celigo.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-celigo
  labels:
    app: baton-celigo
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-celigo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-celigo
        baton: true
        baton-app: celigo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-celigo
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-celigo:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-celigo
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-celigo-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Celigo connector to. Celigo data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Celigo connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
