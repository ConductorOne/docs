<Info>
*Due to a limitation of the underlying API, the Cortex XDR **Account Admin** role cannot be granted or revoked by this connector.

## Gather Cortex XDR credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Cortex XDR. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
An **Instance Administrator** in Cortex XDR must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate an API key

<Steps>
<Step>
In Cortex XDR, navigate to **Settings > Configurations > Integrations > API Keys**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **+ New Key**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose the type of API Key you want to generate based on your desired security level: Advanced or Standard. 
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If desired, set an expiration date and time for the API key and add a comment describing its use. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the key the **Instance Administrator** role. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Generate**, then carefully copy and save the new API key. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Look up the API key ID

<Steps>
<Step>
In the API keys table, locate the key you just created. 
</Step>
<Step>
Find and copy the key's **ID**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Cortex XDR connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Cortex XDR credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Cortex XDR** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Cortex XDR connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the Cortex XDR credentials into the relevant fields. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Cortex XDR connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Cortex XDR](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-palo-alto-cortex) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the Cortex XDR connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Cortex XDR connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Cortex XDR connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-palo-alto-cortex-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-palo-alto-cortex-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Cortex XDR credentials
  BATON_CORTEX_API_KEY: <Cortex XDR API key>
  BATON_CORTEX_API_KEY_ID: <Cortex XDR API key ID>
  BATON_CORTEX_BASE_URL: <Base URL for your Cortex XDR instance>
  
  # Optional: Include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

<Info>
See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.
</Info>

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-palo-alto-cortex.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-palo-alto-cortex
  labels:
    app: baton-palo-alto-cortex
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-palo-alto-cortex
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-palo-alto-cortex
        baton: true
        baton-app: palo-alto-cortex
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-palo-alto-cortex
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-palo-alto-cortex:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-palo-alto-cortex
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-palo-alto-cortex-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Cortex XDR connector to. Cortex XDR data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Cortex XDR connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
