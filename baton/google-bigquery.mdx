## Gather Google BigQuery credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Google BigQuery. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the permission to make a service account in Google Cloud must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a service account

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Google Cloud console, navigate to the **Create service account** page.
</Step>
<Step>
Select your project.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose a name for the service account and enter it in the **Service account name** field.

   Google Cloud automatically sets the service account ID based on the name you choose.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a description for the service account in the **Service account description** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create and continue**.
</Step>
<Step>
From the **Select a role** list, grant the service account either the **Viewer** or **BigQuery Data Viewer** role.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Continue**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Done** to create the service account.
</Step>
</Steps>  

### Create a service account key

<Steps>
<Step>
Still in the Google Cloud console, click the email address of the service account you created in Step 1.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Keys**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add key** > **Create new key**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create**. A JSON file containing the account key is created and downloaded. Keep the downloaded file safe, you'll use it to set up the connector.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Close**.
</Step>
</Steps> 

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Google BigQuery connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Google BigQuery credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Google BigQuery** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Google BigQuery connector:

    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

    - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Upload the JSON file you created in the **Credentials (JSON)** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Google BigQuery connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Google BigQuery](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-google-bigquery) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.** 

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Google BigQuery connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Google BigQuery connector:

    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

    - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Google BigQuery connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-google-bigquery-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-google-bigquery-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
data:
  # Google BigQuery credentials
  BATON_CREDENTIALS_JSON: <base64 encoded credentials JSON>
```

**Base64 Encoding:** Use `echo -n "your-value" | base64` to encode your secrets.

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-google-bigquery.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-google-bigquery
  labels:
    app: baton-google-bigquery
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-google-bigquery
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-google-bigquery
        baton: true
        baton-app: google-bigquery
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-google-bigquery
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-google-bigquery:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-google-bigquery
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-google-bigquery-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Google BigQuery connector to. Google BigQuery data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Google BigQuery connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
