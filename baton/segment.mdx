## Gather Segment credentials 

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Segment. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **Workspace Owner** role in the Segment workspace must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate an API token

<Steps>
<Step>
In Segment, click **Settings**. 
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Workspace Settings** page, click **Access Management**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **Tokens** tab and click **+ Create Token**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new token a name, such as "ConductorOne". 
</Step>
<Step>
Assign the token the **Workspace Owner** access level. 

   This access level is required to read information about groups, resources, and roles in the workspace. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Carefully copy and save the new token.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Segment connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Segment credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Segment** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Segment connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the API token into the **API token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Your Segment connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Segment](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-segment) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Segment connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Segment connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>
### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Segment connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-segment-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-segment-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Segment credentials
  BATON_TOKEN: <Segment API token>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-segment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-segment
  labels:
    app: baton-segment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-segment
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-segment
        baton: true
        baton-app: segment
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-segment
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-segment:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-segment
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-segment-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Segment connector to. Segment data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Segment connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
