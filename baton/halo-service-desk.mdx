<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Capabilities 

| Resource | Sync | Provision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Accounts | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |  |
| Roles | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |  |
| Teams | <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid"  color="#65DE23"/> |  | 

This connector can also be configured to automatically create and update HaloITSM tickets to track manual provisioning assignments. Go to [Configure HaloITSM as an external ticketing provider](/product/admin/external-ticketing#configure-haloitsm-as-an-external-ticketing-provider) to learn more. 

## Gather HaloITSM credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in HaloITSM. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

<Warning>
A user with the **admin** role in HaloITSM must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a new application

<Steps>
<Step>
In HaloITSM, navigate to **Configuration** (the gear icon) > **Advanced** > **Integrations**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **HaloITSM API**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Applications** section, click **View Applications**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **New** to create a new application.
</Step>
<Step>
Fill in the **Details** tab:

  - Application Name: Give your integration a meaningful name (e.g., "My External Integration").

  - Authentication Method: Select Client ID and Secret (Services). This will allow you to generate the required credentials for a machine-to-machine flow (Client Credentials Grant).

  - Login Type: Select Agent.

  - Agent to log in as: Select the specific agent account you want the integration to act as. This agent's permissions will determine what the integration can do.
</Step>
<Step>
HaloITSM will generate the Client ID and Client Secret. Immediately copy and securely store both of these values, especially the Client Secret, as it may only be viewable once.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Define the app's permissions

<Steps>
<Step>
Switch to the new application's **Permissions** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the necessary privileges for your integration:

  - Permissions for User/Team/Role Management: Agent role or higher

  - Permissions for Ticketing: User role with Ticket Read permission (for listing ticket schemas and retrieving tickets)
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save** to finalize the application setup.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the HaloITSM connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of HaloITSM credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **HaloITSM** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new HaloITSM connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the organization API access token into the **Access token** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste the **Client ID** and **Client secret** into into the relevant fields.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you want to automatically create HaloITSM tickets to track provisioning tasks, click **Enable external ticket provisioning**. [Learn more about external ticketing system integrations.](/product/admin/external-ticketing)
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your HaloITSM connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [HaloITSM](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-halo-service-desk) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**  

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the HaloITSM connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new HaloITSM connector:

   - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   - Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

   Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
</Step>
</Steps> 

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your HaloITSM connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-halo-service-desk-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-halo-service-desk-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # HaloITSM credentials
  BATON_DOMAIN_URL: <URL of your HaloITSM domain, in "https://yourcompany.haloitsm.com" format>
  BATON_USERNAME: <HaloITSM client ID>
  BATON_API_KEY: <HaloITSM client secret>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to create provisioning tickets in HaloITSM
  BATON_TICKETING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-halo-service-desk.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-halo-service-desk
  labels:
    app: baton-halo-service-desk
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-halo-service-desk
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-halo-service-desk
        baton: true
        baton-app: halo-service-desk
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-halo-service-desk
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-halo-service-desk:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-halo-service-desk
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-halo-service-desk-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the HaloITSM connector to. HaloITSM data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your HaloITSM connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
