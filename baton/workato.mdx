## Gather Workato credentials 

Each setup method requires you to pass in credentials generated in Workato. Gather these credentials before you move on. 

### Create a client role

<Steps>
<Step>
 In Workato, navigate to **Workspace admin** > **API clients** > **Client roles** > **Add client role**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new client role a name, such as "ConductorOne integration role". 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the following endpoints: 

    | Area         | Section              | Action                      | API Endpoint                       |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **Projects** | Projects & Folders   | List projects               | `GET /api/projects`                |
    |              | Projects & Folders   | List folders                | `GET /api/folders`                 |
    | **Admin**    | Collaborators        | Get collaborators           | `GET /api/members`                 |
    |              | Collaborators        | Get collaborator            | `GET /api/members/:id`             |
    |              | Collaborators        | Update collaborators' roles* | `PUT /api/members/:id`             |
    |              | Collaborators        | Get collaborator privileges | `GET /api/members/:id/privileges`  |
    |              | Collaborator roles   | List non-system roles       | `GET /api/roles`                   |
    *If you don't want to use ConductorOne to provision role assignments, you can skip **Update collaborator’s roles**.
</Step>
<Step>
Save the new role.  
</Step>
</Steps>

### Create an API client

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Workspace admin** and select **API clients** > **Create API client**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new client a name, such as "ConductorOne integration". 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the client role you set up above. 
</Step>
<Step>
If your workspace has environments enabled, select the environment the API client (and by extension, ConductorOne) is allowed to access.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the projects the API client is allowed to access. 
</Step>
<Step>
If needed, add allowed IP ranges that API requests using this token can originate from ([view ConductorOne's IP addresses](/baton/faq/)). 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create client** 
</Step>
<Step>
The new client's API token is shown. Carefully copy and save the API token. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Look up your data center location

You'll also need to specify the location of your Workato data center. Workato displays your data center in the base URL of the API endpoint: 

* US Data Center: https://www.workato.com/api/
* EU Data Center: https://app.eu.workato.com/api/
* JP Data Center: https://app.jp.workato.com/api/
* SG Data Center: https://app.sg.workato.com/api/
* AU Data Center: https://app.au.workato.com/api/

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions. 

## Configure the Workato connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Workato credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Workato** and click **Add**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Workato connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the API token in the **API key** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Data center** field, enter one of `us`, `eu`, `jp`, `sg`, or `au` to identify the location of your Workato data center. The default is `us`. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Environment** field, enter one of `dev`, `test`, or `prod` to identify your Workato environment. The default is `dev`. 
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If desired, check the box to **Disable custom roles sync**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
<Step>
The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Workato connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Workato](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-workato) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Configure the Workato connector

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to set up the new Workato connector: 

   * Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)

   * Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)

   * Create a new managed app
</Step>
<Step>
Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed. 

   If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret. 

Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Workato connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-workato-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-workato-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Workato credentials
  BATON_WORKATO_API_KEY: <Workato API key>
  BATON_WORKATO_DATA_CENTER: <Your Workato data center (one of us, eu, jp, sg, or au). Default is us.>
  BATON_WORKATO_ENV: <Your Workato environment (one of dev, test, or prod). Default is 'dev'>

  # Optional: include if you don't want to sync custom Workato roles
  BATON_DISABLE_CUSTOM_ROLES_SYNC: true

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable  
# baton-workato.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-workato
  labels:
    app: baton-workato
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-workato
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-workato
        baton: true
        baton-app: workato
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-workato
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-workato:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-workato
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-workato-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files. 
</Step>
<Step>
Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Workato connector to. Workato data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Workato connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
