The Azure DevOps connector supports [automatic account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning).

This connector does not support account deprovisioning. You must deprovision accounts directly in Azure DevOps.

## Gather Azure DevOps credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Azure DevOps. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with **Project Collection Administrator** role at the organization level and **Project Administrator** role at the project level must perform this task.
</Warning>

You can authenticate the Azure DevOps connector by registering a web app and signing in with OAuth, or by using a personal access token. Follow the relevant set of instructions below to create your preferred set of credentials.

### Option 1: Register a web application

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In Azure DevOps, navigate to **App registrations** and create a new app.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Give the new app a name and select the **Accounts in any organizational directory** option.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Enter `https://accounts.conductor.one/oauth/callback` as a **Web** redirect URI.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Register**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Carefully copy and save the application (client) ID.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Certificates & secrets** and create a new secret.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Carefully copy and save the secret **Value** (not the secret ID).
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Finally, click **API permissions** and select **Azure DevOps**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Give the app the following permissions:
    - user\_impersonation (Azure DevOps only allows delegated permissions)
    - vso.graph\_manage
    - vso.memberentitlementmanagement\_write
    - vso.profile
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Add permissions**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Carefully copy and save your **Azure tenant ID** and **organization URL**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

### Option 2: Create a personal access token

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In Azure DevOps, navigate to your users settings (the person icon in the top menu bar) and select **personal access tokens**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **\+ New Token**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Give the new token a name, such as "ConductorOne", then select the relevant organization and set an expiration date.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Under **Scopes**, select **Custom defined** and set the relevant set of scopes:
    To give the connector READ (sync only) permissions:
    - **Graph: Read** - Enables all Graph API read operations (users, groups, service principals, memberships, storage keys, descriptors, subject queries)
    - **Project and Team: Read** - Enables all Core API read operations (projects, teams, team members)
    To give the connector READ/WRITE (sync and provision) permissions:
    - **Graph: Read & manage** - Enables all Graph API read and write operations (users, groups, service principals, memberships, storage keys, descriptors, subject queries)
    - **Member Entitlement Management: Read & write** - Enables all Entitlements API read and write operations (list, create, and update user entitlements and licenses)
    - **Project and Team: Read** - Enables all Core API read operations (projects, teams, team members)
    To enable incremental sync (optional):
    - **Audit Log: Read** - Required if you want to enable the incremental sync feature, which syncs only changes since the last sync
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Create**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The new token is created. Carefully copy and save the token.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.
