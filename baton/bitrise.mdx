<Warning>
**This connector is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve stability. Beta connectors are generally stable, but they may have limited feature support, incomplete error handling, or occasional issues.

We recommend closely monitoring workflows that use this connector and contacting our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

## Gather Bitrise configuration information

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in information from Bitrise. Gather these configuration details before you move on.

Here's the information you'll need:

- API Token

See the Bitrise docs for information on how to acquire credentials: [View the documentation](https://docs.bitrise.io/en/bitrise-ci/api/authenticating-with-the-bitrise-api.html)

This connector requires the following scopes:

- Workspace Role:Viewer
- Project Role:Admin

<Card title="Learn how to set the scopes" icon="book"  horizontal href="https://docs.bitrise.io/en/bitrise-platform/workspaces/workspace-api-token.html#workspace-api-token" />

## Configure the Bitrise connector

<Warning>
**To complete this task, you'll need:**

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Bitrise configuration information gathered by following the instructions above

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Bitrise** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Bitrise connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter the configuration information from the previous section.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Bitrise connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the Bitrise connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Bitrise connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new Bitrise connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.
	Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Bitrise connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-bitrise-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-bitrise-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>

  # Bitrise config
  BATON_BITRISE_API_TOKEN: <Bitrise API Token>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-bitrise.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-bitrise
  labels:
    app: baton-bitrise
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-bitrise
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-bitrise
        baton: true
        baton-app: bitrise
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-bitrise
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-bitrise:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-bitrise
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-bitrise-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Bitrise connector to. Bitrise data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Bitrise connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
