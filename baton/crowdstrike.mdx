## Gather CrowdStrike credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in CrowdStrike. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with the **Falcon Administrator** role in CrowdStrike must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Create a CrowdStrike API client

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Sign into the Falcon console and navigate to **Support** > **API Clients and Keys**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **+ Add new API client**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Give the new API client a name, such as "ConductorOne integration" and add a description.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **API SCOPES** section of the page, select the appropriate **User management** scopes:
    - **Read** and **Write** to sync access data and provision CrowdStrike roles
    - **Read** to sync access data
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **ADD**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The new API client is created, and its client ID and client secret are shown. Carefully copy and save these credentials.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the CrowdStrike connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of CrowdStrike credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **CrowdStrike** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new CrowdStrike connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Client ID** and **Client secret** fields, enter the CrowdStrike credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  **Optional.** Enter your CrowdStrike region in the **Region** field. The default region is **US-1**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your CrowdStrike connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [CrowdStrike](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-crowdstrike) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new CrowdStrike connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new CrowdStrike connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

  Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your CrowdStrike connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-crowdstrike-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-crowdstrike-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # CrowdStrike credentials
  BATON_CROWDSTRIKE_CLIENT_ID: <Client ID for the CrowdStrike API client>
  BATON_CROWDSTRIKE_CLIENT_SECRET: <Client secret for the CrowdStrike API client>
  BATON_REGION: <CrowdStrike region, options include 'us-1' (default), 'us-2', 'eu-1', and 'us-gov-1'>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-crowdstrike.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-crowdstrike
  labels:
    app: baton-crowdstrike
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-crowdstrike
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-crowdstrike
        baton: true
        baton-app: crowdstrike
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-crowdstrike
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-crowdstrike:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-crowdstrike
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-crowdstrike-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Applications**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the CrowdStrike connector to. CrowdStrike data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your CrowdStrike connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
