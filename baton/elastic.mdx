## Gather Elastic credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in Elastic. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Warning>
A user with the **Organization owner** role in Elastic must perform this task.
</Warning>

### Generate an Elastic Cloud API key

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In the Elasticsearch Service Console, click your avatar in the upper right corner and select **Organization**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Navigate to the **API keys** tab and click **Create API key**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Give the new API key a name, such as "ConductorOne integration".
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Select an expiration for the API key.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Assign roles** area, give the API key the **Organization owner** role.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Create API key**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Carefully and copy and save the new API key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### (Optional) Generate an Elastic deployment API key and look up the deployment's endpoint

The credentials generated in this step are required for ConductorOne to sync information on Elastic deployment users and deployment roles, and to provision Elastic deployment role assignments. If you **do not** want to sync or provision deployment users or deployment roles, skip this section.

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Back on the Elasticsearch Service Console homepage, find the **Hosted deployments** area of the page and click the name of the deployment you want to integrate.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  On the deployment's page, click **Manage permissions**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the sidebar, click **API keys** > **Create API key**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Give the new API key a name, such as "ConductorOne deployment info integration".
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Select the **Personal API key** option.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Create API key**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Carefully and copy and save the new API key.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  We also need to look up the deployment's Elasticsearch endpoint. Click the Elastic logo to return to your deployment's home page.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Add integrations**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the upper right corner of the screen, click **Connection details**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Carefully copy and save the Elasticsearch endpoint.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Elastic connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Elastic credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Elastic** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Elastic connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  **Optional.** If you want to sync information on Elastic deployment users and deployment roles, paste the **Deployment API key** and **Deployment endpoint** into their respective fields.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  **Optional.** By default, ConductorOne will sync information about all users in all organizations. If you want to limit the sync to a single organization, paste that organization's ID into the **Organization ID** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Elastic connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [Elastic](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-elastic) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Elastic connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Elastic connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

  Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Elastic connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-elastic-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-elastic-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Elastic credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <Elastic API key>
  BATON_DEPLOYMENT_API_KEY: <Elasticsearch deployment API key>
  BATON_DEPLOYMENT_ENDPOINT: <Elasticsearch deployment endpoint>

  # Optional: include if you want ConductorOne to provision access using this connector
  BATON_PROVISIONING: true
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-elastic.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-elastic
  labels:
    app: baton-elastic
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-elastic
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-elastic
        baton: true
        baton-app: elastic
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-elastic
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-elastic:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-elastic
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-elastic-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Elastic connector to. Elastic data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Elastic connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
