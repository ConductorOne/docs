## Gather BambooHR credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials generated in BambooHR. Gather these credentials before you move on.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Log into your BambooHR **Administrator** account.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Make a note of the company domain, which is found in the URL.
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/product/assets/bamboohr-1.png)
    </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Next we'll create a BambooHR API token. The user that creates the API token must be assigned an access level with these permissions:

	- Personal » Basic Info » Status - View Only
	- Personal » Contact » Work Email - View Only
	- Personal » Basic Info » First Name - View Only
	- Personal » Basic Info » Last Name - View Only
	- Job » Job Information » Reporting To - View Only
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click the **BambooHR icon** in the top right corner of the page and select **API Keys**.
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/product/assets/bamboohr-2.png)
    </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    On the API Keys page, select **Add New Key**.
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/product/assets/bamboohr-3.png)
    </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter a name for your new key and then click **Generate Key**.
    <Frame>
    ![](/images/product/assets/bamboohr-4.png)
    </Frame>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Copy the newly generated API key.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the BambooHR connector

<Warning>
**To complete this task, you'll need:**

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of BambooHR credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **BambooHR v2** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new BambooHR connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Enter your company's BambooHR domain into the **Company domain** field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Paste the API key into the **API key** field.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Save**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your BambooHR connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">
**Follow these instructions to use the [BambooHR](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-bamboohr) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Resources

* [Official download center](https://dist.conductorone.com/ConductorOne/baton-bamboohr): For stable binaries (Windows/Linux/macOS) and container images.

### Step 1: Set up a new BambooHR connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Choose how to set up the new BambooHR connector:

	- Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
	- Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
	- Create a new managed app
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
	If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Next**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.
	Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your BambooHR connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-bamboohr-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-bamboohr-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # BambooHR credentials
  BATON_API_KEY: <The API key generated for this integration>
  BATON_COMPANY_DOMAIN: <Your company's BambooHR domain>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-bamboohr.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-bamboohr
  labels:
    app: baton-bamboohr
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-bamboohr
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-bamboohr
        baton: true
        baton-app: bamboohr
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-bamboohr
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-bamboohr:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-bamboohr
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-bamboohr-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the BambooHR connector to. BambooHR data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
    </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your BambooHR connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
