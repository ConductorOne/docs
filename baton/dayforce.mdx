## Gather Dayforce credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials for Dayforce. Gather these credentials before you move on.

Here's the set of credentials you'll need when setting up the connector:

- Username and password for your account or for a service account
- Dayforce tenant URL
- Dayforce client namespace

### Permissions required for the Dayforce account

Set the following roles and permissions on the account or service account you use for the integration:

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Navigate to **System Admin** > **Roles**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  On the **Features** tab, enable the **Read Data** subfeature under **HCM Anywhere** > **Web Services**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  On the **Web Services Field-Level Access** tab, enable **XRefCode** (and relevant child nodes for Employee) under **RESTful Services** > **Human Resources** > **Employee**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  On the **Authorizations** tab, set the following:
    - Can Read for Employee Status Information
    - Can Read for Employee Contact Information - Personal and/or Employee Contact Information - Business
    - Can Read for Employee Profile - Security Settings - Roles
    - Can Read for Employee Profile - Security Settings - User Document Security
    - Can Read for Employee Profile - Security Settings - Pay Code Groups
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Finally, set location access for the user:
    - Navigate to **System Admin** > **User** and select the user.
    - Click **Location Access** > **Add Location** and select the appropriate location.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.
