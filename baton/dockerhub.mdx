## Gather Docker Hub credentials

Configuring the connector requires you to pass in credentials for Docker Hub. Gather these credentials before you move on.

Here's the set of credentials you'll need when setting up the connector:

- The username and password of a Docker Hub account

**That's it!** Next, move on to the connector configuration instructions.

## Configure the Docker Hub connector

<Warning>
To complete this task, you'll need:

- The **Connector Administrator** or **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Access to the set of Docker Hub credentials generated by following the instructions above
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Cloud-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.**

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** and click **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Docker Hub** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Docker Hub connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Find the **Settings** area of the page and click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Enter the username and password for the Docker Hub account you'll use for this integration in the **Username** and **Password** fields.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  The connector's label changes to **Syncing**, followed by **Connected**. You can view the logs to ensure that information is syncing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Docker Hub connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Self-hosted">

**Follow these instructions to use the [Docker Hub](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-dockerhub) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.**

When running in service mode on Kubernetes, a self-hosted connector maintains an ongoing connection with ConductorOne, automatically syncing and uploading data at regular intervals. This data is immediately available in the ConductorOne UI for access reviews and access requests.

### Step 1: Set up a new Docker Hub connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  In ConductorOne, navigate to **Integrations** > **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Search for **Baton** and click **Add**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose how to set up the new Docker Hub connector:
    - Add the connector to a currently unmanaged app (select from the list of apps that were discovered in your identity, SSO, or federation provider that aren't yet managed with ConductorOne)
    - Add the connector to a managed app (select from the list of existing managed apps)
    - Create a new managed app
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Set the owner for this connector. You can manage the connector yourself, or choose someone else from the list of ConductorOne users. Setting multiple owners is allowed.

  If you choose someone else, ConductorOne will notify the new connector owner by email that their help is needed to complete the setup process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Next**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  In the **Settings** area of the page, click **Edit**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Rotate** to generate a new Client ID and Secret.

  Carefully copy and save these credentials. We'll use them in Step 2.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes configuration files

Create two Kubernetes manifest files for your Docker Hub connector deployment:

#### Secrets configuration

```yaml
# baton-dockerhub-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: baton-dockerhub-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # ConductorOne credentials
  BATON_CLIENT_ID: <ConductorOne client ID>
  BATON_CLIENT_SECRET: <ConductorOne client secret>
  
  # Docker Hub credentials
  BATON_USERNAME: <username for the Docker Hub account>
  BATON_PASSWORD: <password to the Docker Hub account>
```

See the connector's README or run `--help` to see all available configuration flags and environment variables.

#### Deployment configuration

```yaml expandable
# baton-dockerhub.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: baton-dockerhub
  labels:
    app: baton-dockerhub
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: baton-dockerhub
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: baton-dockerhub
        baton: true
        baton-app: dockerhub
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: baton-dockerhub
        image: ghcr.io/conductorone/baton-dockerhub:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        env:
        - name: BATON_HOST_ID
          value: baton-dockerhub
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: baton-dockerhub-secrets
```

### Step 3: Deploy the connector

<Steps>
  <Step>
  Create a namespace in which to run ConductorOne connectors (if desired), then apply the secret config and deployment config files.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Check that the connector data uploaded correctly. In ConductorOne, click **Apps**. On the **Managed apps** tab, locate and click the name of the application you added the Docker Hub connector to. Docker Hub data should be found on the **Entitlements** and **Accounts** tabs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your Docker Hub connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
