# ConductorOne documentation

Welcome to the official repository for [ConductorOne Documentation](https://www.conductorone.com/docs)! 

We believe that great documentation is a community effort. This repository contains the source files for our docs site, and we’re excited to open it up for public contributions. Whether you've found a typo, a broken link, or have a suggestion for a new guide, we welcome your input.

## 🚀 How to contribute

There are two ways to suggest changes:

### 1. For a quick fix: Suggest edits
On any page of our [documentation site](https://www.conductorone.com/docs), scroll to the bottom and click **Suggest edits**. This will take you directly to the GitHub editor for that specific file, where you can make changes and submit a Pull Request (PR) in just a few clicks.

### 2. For power users: Fork & PR
If you have larger changes or want to work locally:
1. **Fork** this repository to your own account.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Commit your edits and push them to your fork.
4. Open a **Pull Request** against our `main` branch.

## 📝 Review process

Every contribution, no matter how small, helps improve the experience for all ConductorOne users. So thank you! 

Once you submit a Pull Request, the **ConductorOne Documentation Team** will review your suggestions. We may ask for clarification or make minor adjustments to ensure consistency with our style guide. Once approved, we’ll merge your changes and they’ll be live on the site shortly after!
