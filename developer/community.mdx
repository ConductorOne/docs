You're not alone in this. The Baton community is active and welcoming.

## Getting help

### GitHub discussions

The primary place for questions and discussions is GitHub:

| Repository | Use for |
|------------|---------|
| [baton-sdk](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-sdk/discussions) | SDK questions, general connector development |
| Specific connector repos | Issues with that connector |

Before asking:
1. Search existing issues and discussions
2. Check this documentation
3. Review the [recipes](/developer/recipes-auth) for common patterns

### What makes a good question

Include:
- What you're trying to accomplish
- What you've tried
- Error messages (full text, not screenshots)
- Relevant code snippets
- Connector version and target system

**Bad:** "My connector doesn't work"

**Good:** "Sync fails with 'unauthorized' error when listing users. Using baton-okta v0.5.2 with API token auth. Token has read_users scope. Full error: [paste error]"

### Support channels

| Channel | Response time | Use for |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| GitHub Issues | Days | Bugs, feature requests |
| GitHub Discussions | Days | Questions, how-to help |
| ConductorOne Support | Hours | Production issues (customers) |

## Reporting issues

### Bug reports

When reporting a bug, include:

| Information | Why it helps |
|------------|--------------|
| Connector name and version | Reproducibility |
| Steps to reproduce | Root cause analysis |
| Expected vs actual behavior | Understanding the issue |
| Error messages | Debugging |
| Environment (OS, Go version) | Platform-specific issues |

**Template:**

```markdown
## Bug Report

**Connector:** baton-yourservice v1.2.3
**Environment:** macOS 14.0, Go 1.23

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Configure connector with API key
2. Run `baton-yourservice --api-key $KEY`
3. Observe error

**Expected:** Sync completes successfully
**Actual:** Sync fails with error: [paste error]

**Logs:** (if helpful)
```

### Feature requests

For new features:
1. Check if the feature already exists (search issues)
2. Describe the use case, not just the solution
3. Explain why existing approaches don't work

Good feature requests describe the problem:
- "I need to sync custom attributes from Okta user profiles so that access reviews show department information"

Not just the solution:
- "Add custom attribute support"
