The ConductorOne application programming interface (API) is a set of rules that defines how ConductorOne can communicate with other software programs. The ConductorOne API lets developers access ConductorOne data and functionality, automate workflows, and connect ConductorOne to other tools and interfaces.

## Get started with the ConductorOne API

To get started with the ConductorOne API, go to the [API docs site](https://api.conductorone.com), which includes full details on the API's methods, parameters, and responses, as well as instructions on [how to authenticate requests to the API](/conductorone-api/a76uioi122862-how-to-authenticate-requests).

## Create a personal API key

Create a personal API key to use when working with the ConductorOne API. 

<Steps>
<Step>
   In the ConductorOne web app, open your profile menu and select **API keys**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create credential**.
</Step>
<Step>
Give your new API key a name and select whether the key will expire. 
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** To limit where the API key can make requests from, enter the allowed IP addresses in the **Limit source IPs** field. Specific IP addresses and CIDRs are both accepted.  
</Step>
<Step>
Select the scope of the API key: 

   - **Full permissions:** Gives the API key full read-write access. 

   - **Read-only Super Administrator:** Gives the API key full read-only access. 

   - **Basic user:** Gives the API key the same limited set of permissions as the **Basic User** [user role](/product/admin/user-roles). 

   - **Read-only to system logs:** Gives the API key access limited to reading system logs. API keys with this permission are ideal to use when setting up [system logs](/product/admin/system-log).
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Your new API key is created and the client ID and client secret are shown. Carefully copy and save the client secret, as it won't be shown again. 
</Step>
</Steps>

The API key is added to list of your personal API clients, and its client ID and usage data for the key are shown. If needed, you can delete the API key from this page. 

## View and manage all API keys for your ConductorOne tenant

<Warning>
Only users with the **Super Administrator** [user role](/product/admin/user-roles) in ConductorOne can view and manage API keys other than their own. 
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **API keys**.
</Step>
</Steps>
