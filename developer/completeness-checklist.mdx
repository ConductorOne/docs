---

Use this checklist before shipping a connector. Each item maps to a specific validation that tooling may eventually automate.

## Resource types

Every connector must define which resources it syncs from the target system.

- **At least one user resource with TRAIT_USER** - Users are the principals that receive access. Without users, there's nothing to grant entitlements to.

- **Each resource type has a unique ID** - Resource type IDs must be unique within the connector. Use lowercase (e.g., `user`, `group`, `project`).

- **Resources with TRAIT_GROUP have a "member" entitlement** - Groups exist to contain members. If something has TRAIT_GROUP, it should have an entitlement that represents membership.

- **Resources with TRAIT_ROLE have an "assigned" entitlement** - Roles exist to be assigned. If something has TRAIT_ROLE, it should have an entitlement that represents assignment.

## Entitlements

Entitlements represent what access exists on a resource.

- **Every entitlement specifies grantableTo** - This declares which principal types can receive the entitlement. Usually `user`, but could also include service accounts or other principals.

- **grantableTo references existing resource types** - The resource types listed in grantableTo must actually exist in your connector.

- **Entitlements have display names** - Human-readable names help operators understand what access is being granted.

- **User resources generally don't have entitlements** - Users receive access, they don't grant it. If you're adding entitlements to users, consider whether you've modeled the relationship correctly.

## Grants

Grants connect principals to entitlements - they represent "who has what."

- **Resources with entitlements have a Grants() implementation** - If a resource has entitlements, you need to sync who currently has those entitlements.

- **Grants() returns grants for each entitlement type** - If a group has both "member" and "admin" entitlements, your Grants() should return grants for both.

- **Grant principals match grantableTo types** - If an entitlement says `grantableTo: [user]`, grants should only reference user resources.

## Provisioning (if supported)

Provisioning enables ConductorOne to actually grant and revoke access.

- **Resources set ExternalId** - The ExternalId is the native system's identifier for the resource. This is required for provisioning because it's how the connector knows which resource to modify.

- **ExternalId uses the native system's identifier** - Use the ID that the target API expects, not a synthetic ID.

- **Grant()/Revoke() contain actual logic** - Stub implementations that return nil aren't provisioning. Verify your methods actually call the target API.

## Structural requirements

These ensure the connector can run at all.

- **Connector implements Metadata()** - Returns connector name and description.

- **Connector implements Validate()** - Tests that credentials are valid and the connection works.

- **Validate() actually tests the connection** - Don't just return nil. Make an API call to verify credentials work.

- **ResourceSyncers() returns at least one syncer** - A connector that syncs nothing isn't useful.

## Quick reference

| Check | Why it matters |
|-------|----------------|
| User with TRAIT_USER | Users receive access - required for any connector |
| TRAIT_GROUP has member entitlement | Groups contain members - that's what makes them groups |
| TRAIT_ROLE has assigned entitlement | Roles are assigned - that's what makes them roles |
| Entitlements have grantableTo | Defines who can receive access |
| Grants() matches entitlements | Syncs current access state |
| ExternalId set | Required for provisioning to work |
| Validate() tests connection | Catches credential problems early |

## Common mistakes

**Modeling access backwards** - Users receive entitlements on groups/roles, not the other way around. If you find yourself adding entitlements to user resources, reconsider your model.

**Missing grants** - Defining entitlements but not implementing Grants() means ConductorOne sees what access exists but not who has it.

**No ExternalId** - Without ExternalId, provisioning can't work because the connector doesn't know which resource to modify.

**Validate() is a stub** - A Validate() that always returns nil doesn't catch credential problems until sync fails.
