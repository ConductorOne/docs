## Before you begin

If you're new to Terraform or need a refresher on core concepts, these resources from HashiCorp will help you get oriented:

- **[Getting Started with Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started)** - Core concepts, basic workflow, and your first configuration
- **[Terraform Language Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language)** - Understanding HCL syntax, resources, and data sources
- **[Provider Configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers/configuration)** - How providers work and how to configure them

## Recommended setup

### State management

Terraform state is critical to how Terraform tracks your ConductorOne resources. For production use, we strongly recommend:

- **Use remote state** - Store your state file in a remote backend (S3, Terraform Cloud, etc.) rather than locally
- **Enable state locking** - Prevent concurrent modifications that could corrupt your state
- **Regular backups** - Ensure your state files are backed up according to your organization's policies

**Learn more:** [Terraform State Management Best Practices](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state)

### Version constraints

Pin both the Terraform version and the ConductorOne provider version to ensure consistent, reproducible deployments:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
  
  required_providers {
    conductorone = {
      source  = "conductorone/conductorone"
      version = "~> [CURRENT_VERSION]"
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance optimization

If you're managing many ConductorOne resources and experiencing slow plan times:

- Use targeted applies when working on specific resources (`terraform apply -target=...`)
- Consider breaking large configurations into multiple state files/workspaces
- Leverage `-refresh=false` when appropriate for faster plans
- Review your provider configuration for any performance settings

## Common questions

### How should our team collaborate on Terraform configurations?

For teams managing ConductorOne infrastructure together, consider:

- **Remote state with locking** to prevent conflicts
- **Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise** for centralized workflow management
- **Version control** for all `.tf` files with standard branching strategies
- **CI/CD integration** to validate and apply changes consistently

**Learn more:** [Terraform Team Workflows](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cloud/cloud-workspace-configure)

### How do we manage different environments (dev/staging/prod)?

Common approaches include:

- **Workspaces** - Multiple named states within a single configuration
- **Separate directories** - Different folders for each environment
- **Terragrunt or similar tools** - For more complex multi-environment setups

Each approach has tradeoffs depending on your team's needs.

### What's the best way to handle secrets and sensitive data?

When working with the ConductorOne provider:

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables or secure secret stores (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Mark sensitive variables with `sensitive = true` in your configuration
- Consider using Terraform Cloud's secure variable storage

### How do we integrate Terraform into our CI/CD pipeline?

Automating Terraform runs can improve consistency and reduce errors:

- Validate configurations on pull requests
- Run plans automatically to preview changes
- Require approvals before applying to production
- Store state and credentials securely in your CI system
