## Gather [App Name] credentials

<Warning>
To configure the [App Name] connector, you need [specific permission level] permissions in [App Name]. [Add any additional permission requirements or warnings about scope implications].
</Warning>

### [Option 1: Primary credential method]

    [Helpful context or best practice]
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create [API token/credentials]">
    1. Navigate to [location in app]
    2. Click **[Button name]**
    3. Enter a name for your [token/app/credentials]: `ConductorOne`
    4. Select the following scopes/permissions:
       - `scope:name` - [Brief description of what this enables]
       - `scope:name` - [Brief description]
       - `scope:name` - [Brief description]
    
    <Warning>
    The **scope:name** scope is used by ConductorOne when automatically provisioning and deprovisioning access. **If you do not want ConductorOne to perform these tasks, do not give your token this scope.**
    </Warning>
    
    5. Click **[Generate/Create]**
    6. Copy the [token/secret/credentials] and save it securely. You'll need it in the next section.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure the [App Name] connector

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cloud-hosted">
    Follow these instructions to use a built-in, no-code connector hosted by ConductorOne.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add the connector">
        1. In ConductorOne, click **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
        2. Search for **[Connector Name]** and click **Add**.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Choose app setup">
        Choose how you want to set up your [App Name] app in ConductorOne:
        
        - **Add to unmanaged app**: Add this connector to an existing unmanaged app. This option is useful if you've already created an app in ConductorOne for [App Name] and want to add this connector to it.
        - **Add to existing managed app**: Add this connector to an existing managed app. This option is useful if you've already set up a connector for [App Name] and want to add another instance.
        - **Create new managed app**: Create a new managed app in ConductorOne for this connector. This option is useful if you haven't yet created an app in ConductorOne for [App Name].
      </Step>

      <Step title="Set the app owner">
        Select the user who will be the owner of the [App Name] app in ConductorOne.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure settings">
        Enter the following information:
        
        - **[Field name]**: [Description of what to enter]
        - **[API token/credentials]**: Paste the [token/credentials] you created earlier
        - **[Other required fields]**: [Instructions]
        
        <Step>
        **Optional.** Enable **Sync secrets** to display them on the [Inventory page](/product/admin/inventory).
        </Step>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Verify the sync">
        Click **Save**. ConductorOne will begin syncing data from [App Name].
        
        To verify the sync is working:
        1. Click **Connectors** in the left navigation
        2. Find your [App Name] connector
        3. Check that the **Last sync** time is recent and there are no errors
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **That's it!** Your [App Name] connector is now pulling access data into ConductorOne.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Self-hosted">
    Follow these instructions to use the [App Name](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-[connector-name]) connector, hosted and run in your own environment.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Set up the connector in ConductorOne">
        1. In ConductorOne, click **Connectors** > **Add connector**.
        2. Search for **[Connector Name]** and click **Add**.
        3. Choose how you want to set up your [App Name] app in ConductorOne (see cloud-hosted instructions above for details).
        4. Set the app owner.
        5. Click **Save**.
        6. Make note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that are displayed. You'll need these values in the next step.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create Kubernetes configuration files">
        Create two files: one for the connector's secrets and one for the deployment.

        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f secrets.yaml
        kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
        ```

        Verify the deployment:
        ```bash
        kubectl get pods -n baton
        kubectl logs -n baton -l app=baton-[connector-name]
        ```
