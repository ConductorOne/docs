<Update label="January 30, 2026">

### Navigation improvements  

We've redesigned the navigation with a unified left sidebar that consolidates end user and admin functions, adds hover-to-reveal menus and pinnable apps, and features a cleaner, more intuitive design that makes it easier to find and access the tools you need.

### Automation and policy agents

We're launching two new AI-powered agents designed specifically to help you build automations and policies faster and more accurately:
  
- The **Automation architect** is a purpose-built agent for creating automations in ConductorOne. Describe the workflow you want, and the agent generates the complete automation with triggers and actions, making it faster to set up complex workflows. You'll find this agent on the **Automations** page. 

- The **Policy architect** helps you build access policies by translating your high-level requirements into detailed CEL expressions. Simply describe the access control rules you need, and the agent generates the corresponding policy conditions. You'll find this agent on the **Policies** page when creating or editing a policy.

These new agents are in beta while we gather feedback and improve functionality. Please let us know what you think!

### Step-up authentication

You can now require step-up authentication for access requests and access reviews. When enabled, users must re-authenticate using multi-factor authentication (MFA) before they can submit access requests or complete review tasks. This additional security measure helps ensure that only authorized users can make changes to access permissions. Check out [Configure step-up authentication](/product/admin/step-up-auth) to learn more.

### Campaign improvements

- Campaigns can now be configured to start and end automatically, eliminating the need for manual intervention. When a campaign is set to auto-start, we'll review data accuracy before launch and notify campaign admins of any issues. You can choose whether campaigns should proceed automatically or wait for manual review when data issues are detected. Further details for how to set auto-start and auto-end on campaigns and templates can be found in [Create an access review campaign](/product/admin/campaigns). 

- The email address for each user's manager is now included in the campaign tasks report. 

### Usability improvements

- You can now display your organization's name and logo in the ConductorOne interface. Navigate to **Settings** > **Branding** to upload your logo and set a display name. 

- You can now write policy conditions that check account types using `AppUserType.SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, `AppUserType.SYSTEM_ACCOUNT`, and `AppUserType.USER`, making it possible to create policies that apply differently to service accounts, system accounts, and human users.

- The CSV report of users, which can be downloaded from the **Users** page, now includes a **User ID** column, indicating the source of each user's identity data.

- The CSV report of tasks, which can be downloaded from the **Task log** page, now includes separate columns for each tasks' **Status** and **StateTimestamp** (noting the time when the task's final action was completed) instead of a combined column. This report also now includes a **Request Reason** column populated with the reason the user provided when submitting the request.

- When reassigning a ticket, you can now select **Reassigned due to approver unresponsive** as a quick response option.

- Task statuses now more accurately report specific policy wait conditions. For example, you'll see "Waiting until scheduled time" or "Waiting for duration" instead of the generic "Awaiting assignee".

- App descriptions (which you can edit on each app's details page) are now shown on the **New request** form to help users quickly identify which application they need.

- Your personal API credentials table now includes a **Scope** column showing each key's permissions (Full Permissions or specific roles).

### Fixed!

- The **Last submitted on** icon is now correctly shown once you've submitted reviews in a campaign. 

</Update>

<Update label="January 23, 2026">

### Requestable automations

Safely expose powerful automations to end users without granting standing admin access. The new requestable automations feature lets you convert backend workflows into governed, on-demand services that users can request from the **Actions** tab in their access catalog.

Configure automations to collect required information via custom forms, apply policy-driven approval gates, and execute steps with full audit trails. Common use cases include just-in-time infrastructure provisioning, scoped admin tasks, and operational workflows like hardware requests or environment management.

Visit [Configure requestable automations](/product/admin/automation-actions) to learn more and get started.

### Batch submit access reviews

You'll now submit multiple access review decisions at once, improving efficiency while maintaining a clean audit trail. Here's how this change will impact your review workflows:

- **For reviewers**: As reviewers make decisions, they're now held in a pending state, allowing reviewers to work through complex campaigns at their own pace and perform a final review of their decisions before they're recorded permanently. When ready, reviewers click **Submit** to finalize all pending decisions in a single batch. Full details can be found in the end-user [How to review access](/product/how-to/review-access#submit-your-decisions) doc.

- **For campaign admins**: Campaign administrators can track all review submissions on the campaign's new **Submissions** tab, which provides a complete log of when reviews were submitted, by whom, and the breakdown of certifications versus denials. Export submission data as a CSV for audit purposes or to analyze reviewer activity patterns.

### Access operations dashboard enhancements

- You can now export key access operations dashboard metrics as CSV files for further analysis. Download data for apps with the most new requests, revocations, and user accounts. Additionally, you can now export a list of open extension requests for all expiring grants and grants expiring within a specified timeframe.

- The new **Response time by user** table shows p50, p90, and p99 response times for each user. All columns are sortable to help you quickly identify bottlenecks in your review processes.

### Usability improvements

- Hover over a connector's name in the page header on the connector details page to reveal a tooltip containing the Connector ID and Catalog ID (if applicable), along with a copy-to-clipboard option.

- Extension tasks now have a dedicated icon to make them easier to identify in task lists.

- The **Revoke** button is now hidden for grants that are inherited through group memberships. This prevents users from attempting to directly revoke access that must be managed at the group level.

</Update>

<Update label="January 16, 2026">

### Extension grant task improvements

When an extension grant task is canceled because the associated app user was deleted (this often occurs because the access times out and the account is automatically deprovisioned), a new request task will now be automatically created. The new task includes a comment linking back to the original canceled request, and the audit log shows the origin of the task and includes a link to the original.

### CEL improvements

* Policy conditions can now leverage `task.subjectUserId` and `task.requestorUserId` in CEL expressions. This enables more granular policy configurations, such as automatically confirming tasks where the requestor is the subject (such as a user revoking their own access).

* You can now see which CEL-based attribute mappings run into errors. Look for the orange triangle indicator on the **Attribute manager** page, and click **View errors** to see what went wrong. No more guessing why a user's profile field is empty!

* The CEL editor has been redesigned for clarity and ease of use. Improved layout, highlighting, and validation make it easier to write, understand, and troubleshoot automation logic.

### Usability improvements

* You can now assign a group as the fallback on any policy step that allows fallback reviewers. This provides additional flexibility in ensuring tasks are always assigned to an available reviewer.

* To streamline the information architecture of the app, we've relocated the **Security** dashboard to the **Analytics** section. 

* Users with the **Access Request Helpdesk** role can now revoke grants, expanding their ability to manage access requests on behalf of users.

* When scoping a campaign, you'll now find that lists of apps are now alphabetized, making it easier to scan and select the applications, groups, or resources you want to include. This small change should make large campaigns faster to configure and review.

### Fixed!

* We resolved an issue where provisioning instructions were not correctly passed to external Jira tickets when multi-step provisioning was configured for an entitlement. Instructions will now appear as expected in the Jira ticket description.

</Update>

<Update label="January 9, 2026">

### Accessibility improvements

We've made significant accessibility improvements to end-user pages in ConductorOne. These pages now meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards, ensuring a more inclusive experience for all users.

Key improvements include:

* **Keyboard navigation** - All interactive elements are now fully keyboard accessible, making it easier for users who prefer or require keyboard navigation
* **Enhanced focus and hover states** - Clear visual indicators help users track their position and interactions on the page
* **Screen reader compatibility** - Proper labels and semantic markup ensure compatibility with screen readers and other assistive technologies
* **Improved contrast ratios** - All text and interactive elements now meet WCAG AA contrast requirements for better readability

These enhancements benefit everyone, from users who rely on assistive technologies to those who simply prefer keyboard navigation or work in challenging viewing conditions.

### Access operations dashboard

On the new **Access operations** tab on the **Analytics** page, you can: 

- See how many access grants are **expiring in the next 24 hours and 7 days**
- Track **open extension requests** 
- Understand outcomes for expiring access over time, including **whether grants expired or were extended**
- Compare your **permanent vs. expiring** grants to get a clearer sense of long‑lived access in your environment
- Monitor **review response times** (p50, p90, p99), filterable by **task type** and **user**, so you can spot bottlenecks and slow approval paths

This dashboard is designed to help teams quickly understand where access is about to change, how reviewers are handling requests, and where review processes may need attention.

### Usability improvements

* You can now configure a policy to **skip a step** or **cancel the task** when an approval step SLA is violated, giving you more control over how your access request workflows handle time-sensitive approvals. 

* Filters now return up to 50 items (increased from 25) when scoping a campaign, making it easier to find and select the resources you need.
  
* The unstructured user access reviews view now spans the full width of the page, providing more space to see details and make informed decisions.

</Update>

<Update label="January 2, 2026">

### Microsoft Teams app live on Microsoft Marketplace

The [ConductorOne integration for Microsoft Teams](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200009797) is now live on Microsoft Marketplace, making it easier to discover, install, and deploy ConductorOne directly within your Microsoft ecosystem. Ready to bring C1 into your Teams workspace? Check out our docs on the [MS Teams integration](/docs/product/admin/ms-teams-public) to get started. 

### Usability updates 

* We've added one-click links to the end-user view of a campaign on the campaign's admin page, both in the header and the send reminder modal. Quickly capture and share these links to let users know exactly where to go to complete their reviews.

   <Frame>
   <img src="/images/product/assets/release-notes-2-jan-26.png" alt="A screenshot of a campaign's Overview tab with the links to the campaign in the header and in the open send reminder modal highlighted."/>
   </Frame> 

* You can now configure the columns shown on the **Assigned to me** and **My requests** tabs of the **Requests** page.

* You now have the option to include a **Resolved on** column when customizing columns on the **Requests** and **Task log** pages, as well as when completing access reviews using the **Unstructured** view. 

### Fixed! 

* We've improved the handling of tasks when a delegated user is assigned but cannot complete a task that they are the subject of because self-approval is not allowed by the task's governing policy. 

</Update>

<Update label="December 19, 2025">

### Usability updates

- Building precise access policies just got simpler. **Directory status** is now a built-in option when selecting a profile attribute within the basic condition builder. This allows you to create and parse CEL conditions based on a user’s status without having to write the expressions manually.
- You can now use `{{ .Resource.Name }}` to reference the display names of resources when setting up [custom templates](/product/admin/external-ticketing#customizing-ticket-templates) for an external ticketing provider.
- We’ve updated Slack notifications for expiring access to include the entitlement description directly below the entitlement name. This small change provides much-needed context, helping users quickly identify exactly what access is about to lapse without having to leave Slack.
- You now have the option to set entitlement description and task number as columns when reviewing tasks in the **By app** or **By user** views. Entitlement descriptions are also now included in the review’s details.

### Fixed!

- We updated a log message that was giving the impression that an action had been completed to more accurately state that the actions has started.
</Update>

<Update label="December 12, 2025">

### Campaign dashboards 

We've supercharged the campaign dashboard to give you more powerful insights on your campaign's progress, with granular data on reviewers, open reviews, and decisions. 

<Frame>
![](/images/product/assets/campaign-dashboard.png)
</Frame>

* **Reviewer performance:** Track reviewer decision rates and average review time. See who's holding up the queue and remind them to finish their reviews.
* **Progress by app:** Gain clarity by precisely tracking review completion status broken down by application.
* **Workflow visualization:** A campaign burndown chart lets you visualize the campaign's remaining open reviews over time.

You'll find the updated dashboard on every running and completed campaign.

### Usability improvements 

* You can now revoke access for yourself or your direct reports from the **App catalog** and **Profile** tabs of the **Requests** page. Click **Revoke** next to a granted entitlement, or revoke entitlements in bulk by selecting the relevant checkboxes and using the bulk actions control at the bottom of the screen.  

   <Frame>
   <img src="/images/product/assets/release-notes-12-dec-25.png" alt="A screenshot of the App catalog tab with the Revoke button for a granted entitlement highlighted."/>
   </Frame>

* We've added a new control on the **Notifications** page that lets admins disable all email notifications for their ConductorOne tenant, including digest emails. 

* Good news, Microsoft Teams users: you can now use the ConductorOne app for Teams to create new access requests. Check out [Request using the Microsoft Teams app](/product/how-to/create-requests#request-using-the-microsoft-teams-app) for details. 

* The `cone get` command now supports [custom form fields](/product/admin/customize-requests#collect-additional-information-from-requestors-using-request-forms) for entitlements, allowing you to provide required data either interactively or non-interactively via the `--form-data` flag. For details, check out [Custom forms](/product/cli/commands#custom-form-fields) in the `cone` docs.
</Update>
<Update label="December 5, 2025">

### Customize user avatars

ConductorOne now supports custom user avatars! To change your own user avatar, open your profile menu in the upper right corner of the screen, click your name, then click the edit icon on your current avatar image. 

Not content just updating your own avatar? On on the user details pages, managers can also upload avatars for their direct reports, and Super Admins can upload avatars for any user.  

### New bulk actions 

* You can now set [attribute values](/product/admin/global-settings#set-attribute-values) in bulk on an application's **Entitlements** tab by selecting the **Set attributes** option from the bulk actions menu. 

* You can also set or update account owners in bulk on an application's **Accounts** tab by selecting **Set account owner** from the bulk actions menu.  

### Usability improvements 

* On the **Requests** page, users can now efficiently search for entitlements across all applications by using the dedicated search filter on the **App catalog** tab. 

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/assets/release-notes-5-dec-25.png" alt="A screenshot of the Requests page showing the App catalog tab selected and a search for the term 'access' returning multiple entitlements from various apps."/>
</Frame>

* If enrollment in an access profile should not be granted indefinitely, you can now set a **Max enrollment duration** on the access profile.

* When creating a [custom request form](/product/admin/customize-requests#create-a-new-request-form), you now have the option to hide the default **Justification** field. 

* A new **Display to user** setting on profile types allows you to choose whether a profile is shown on users' details pages. 

* On a campaign's **Tasks** tab, click the **Generate CSV** icon to create and download a report containing all tasks included in the campaign. 

* On the **Analytics** page, click any app name in the **Access management overview** section to see details on the requests, revocations, or accounts for that app within the selected time period. Click the **Generate CSV** icon to create and download a report of this data. 

* To make it easier for users to understand exactly what they're reviewing in a campaign, the by-user reviews view now shows the exact entitlement under review instead of the parent resource. 

* We've consolidated entitlement provisioning and deprovisioning settings into a single new **Access management** section on an entitlement's details page. 

* When clicking to the next or previous page of a table, the view now automatically scrolls to the top, improving the navigation experience.

### Platform updates 

* You can now create campaigns and campaign templates using Terraform. 

### Fixed!

* We resolved an issue that was impacting the accuracy of grant counts on the ConductorOne app. 

* The data preview shown when adding user profile attributes now accurately accounts for all mapping sources and profile types, ensuring you can reliably test your mappings before deployment.

* When completing reviews using the unstructured view, the **All** filter now correctly displays all tasks, including both completed and incomplete items, providing a comprehensive view of review progress.

* When mapping file attributes, your selected custom attribute value no longer vanishes when a mapping is selected.

* If a task is reassigned, its governing policy's settings, such as requiring justification, are enforced correctly. 

* Tasks and follow-up information requests are now correctly created for multi-entitlement requests where some entitlements in the batch have a required form and others do not. 

* You can now successfully upload Python-generated .xlsx files. 
</Update>
<Update label="November 21, 2025">

### Customize your columns and filters

A highly requested feature is here! You can now customize and rearrange the columns displayed on the **Task log** page and when completing access reviews using the **Unstructured** view. To create your personalized table, click the column icon in the upper-left corner of the table, select the columns you want to see on the page, and drag them into the order you prefer. ConductorOne will save your customizations even when you refresh the page or navigate away. 

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/assets/release-notes-21-nov-25.png" alt="A screenshot of the Task log page with the column personalization dropdown open and three columns selected."/>
</Frame>

You can also select which filters you want to use on the **Task log** page by using the new **Filters** dropdown. 

### Usability improvements

* We've added a new query to the **Access explorer** page: **Active external accounts**. This list can be downloaded as a CSV for easy sharing and analysis.

* You can now create fine-grained revoke entitlement steps in your automations. Use criteria such as the entitlement risk level or compliance framework to zero in on which entitlements to revoke or to exclude from revocation. 

* The task report you can generate and download on the **Task log** page now includes details on who approved each task and the approver's email address, making it easier to track and audit approval workflows.

* When creating [attribute mappings](/product/admin/attributes) in the new directory UI, you can use a mix of direct mappings and CEL expressions for each source. This allows you to set up complex fallback logic, which is especially useful for attributes that accept multiple values, such as Additional Usernames.

* You can now configure the deprovisioning process to be used for an entitlement on the entitlement's details page, providing more granular control over resource clean-up. 

* The Microsoft Teams app now sends notifications to the relevant admins when a connector experiences a sync error or detects an anomaly in the synced data.

* You'll find a new **Access management overview** section on the **Analytics** page, which show the apps with the most new requests, new revocations, and total user accounts for the selected time period.

### Fixed! 

* Custom user profile attribute mappings are now preserved when you upload a new file to replace an existing one in a file connector.

* We fixed a bug in the **App catalog** that prevented you from deselecting any entitlements once 10 had been selected. 

* If a bulk action requires a reason or comment, the comment field will not be hidden by default. 
</Update>
<Update label="November 14, 2025">

### Introducing Super Directory 

We've launched a powerful update to ConductorOne user management, separating account creation from attribute management. Designate a single source of truth for users and effortlessly pull additional user data from any connected app. View the docs on [connecting a directory](/product/admin/directory) and [mapping user data](/product/admin/attributes) for details.

Plus, meet **profile types**. This new feature lets you easily segment your diverse workforce (like employees versus contractors) to ensure administrators only see the exact user data they need, simplifying management and boosting efficiency. To learn more and get started, visit the [profile types](/product/admin/profile-types) documentation. 

### Microsoft Teams integration 

With the new [ConductorOne app for Microsoft Teams](/product/admin/ms-teams), you can interact directly with ConductorOne without leaving Teams to manage access requests, receive notifications for new approval tasks, and approve or deny requests directly from the Teams interface. This integration also allows users to track the progress of their open access requests and get immediate updates. 

### Usability improvements

* The [updated access reviews experience](/product/release-notes#updated-access-reviews-experience) we announced a few weeks ago is now live for all ConductorOne customers. We've also added the toggle that lets you move between all assigned reviews and those still awaiting a decision to the unstructured reviews view. 

* On the **Analytics** page, you'll now find cards tracking the average completion time for request, revocation, and review tasks. Additionally, we've introduced a new **Identities** section, which displays new and total accounts broken down by user or service type. (Please note that data in this section from before November 1, 2025 might not be accurate.)

* Accounts that are not associated with an email address from a [trusted domain](/product/admin/global-settings#set-trusted-domains) are now labeled **External** across ConductorOne, and indicated on each entitlement's **Grants** tab with a globe icon. 

* We've added a dropdown data type to [custom forms](/product/admin/customize-requests#collect-additional-information-from-requestors-using-request-forms), allowing administrators to define selectable options for users.

* To improve security, users with the **Campaign Admin** role can now only see and modify campaign that they also own. 

### Platform updates

* You can now manage [vaults](/product/admin/vaults) using the ConductorOne API and Terraform provider. 

### Fixed! 

* We repaired an issue that was preventing users with the **Read-Only Admin** user role from viewing all campaigns.

* You can successfully reference attribute names that contain spaces when creating a profile type membership automation.

* Prior search results are cleared properly when you move on to a new screen when building a campaign. 
</Update>
<Update label="October 31, 2025">

### Early access: Analytics

We're excited to bring you an early access launch of a much-requested feature, which will help you see at a glance how access is changing over time in your organization. On the new **Analytics** page, you'll find customizable graphs and high-level metrics about the requests, revocations, and reviews flowing through ConductorOne in the past day, week, or month.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/assets/release-notes-31-oct-25.png" alt="A screenshot of new Analytics page showing graphs and summary data of requests and revocations in the past month."/>
</Frame>

Please be aware that open review ticket data from early October might not be fully accurate. We're already working to expand and improve this feature, so send us your feedback and ideas! 

### Usability updates 

* You can now require that a different user approves each step in request and review policies. Enable **Require distinct approvers** on a step to prevent users who approved previous steps from approving the current one.  For full details, visit the docs on [Policies](/product/admin/policies). 

* Need a report of all the access granted to a certain application account? You can now create and download one by navigating to **Requests** > **Accounts** > **View access** and clicking the **Generate CSV** button. 

</Update>
<Update label="October 24, 2025">

### Updated access reviews experience

We're rolling out an updated experience for completing access reviews by app. The new design lets users toggle between all assigned reviews and those still awaiting a decision. We've also streamlined the page design to use space more effectively and make it easier to quickly complete your assigned reviews. 


<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/assets/release-notes-24-oct-25.png" alt="A screenshot of the updated access reviews by app interface, showing the new to-do and all toggle options at the top of the page."/>
</Frame>


<Tip>
**Don't see this update yet?** To avoid disrupting in-progress work, we're rolling out the new access review design in phases. Customers without an active campaign will see the new design immediately. If you have an active campaign, we'll enable the new design once your current campaign concludes. [Let our support team know](mailto:support@conductorone.com) if you have any questions. 
</Tip>

### Usability updates

- We've added new time functions to our CEL library, allowing you to work with dates and times in CEL expressions. Visit the [CEL expression reference on time functions](/product/admin/expressions-reference#time-functions) to learn more and see examples.  

- We've updated the design of the bulk action submission modal to make it clearer that adding a comment is optional. The comment field remains is now hidden by default. If you want to leave a note, click **Add comment** to reveal the input form.

- Users with the **Super Admin** role can now create a revoke task for a grant when access is no longer needed or appropriate from the **Accounts** tab of a user's details page. 

- For teams using ConductorOne's [Copilot-powered service desk integration](/product/admin/service-desk), a new **Auto-submit requests** setting is available. When enabled, all valid requests will be automatically submitted, and only invalid requests will be routed to your team for manual review.

- You'll now see a notification popup when the process of closing a campaign gets underway, and another when the campaign has been successfully closed.

### Fixed! 

- If [last login data is available](/baton/capabilities), it is included in the information on a task's **Details** tab. 
</Update>
<Update label = "October 17, 2025">

### Usability updates

- Campaign reports now include a notation of whether the campaign was scoped to include only accounts associated with [email domains that are marked trusted or external to your organization](/product/admin/global-settings#set-trusted-domains). 

- To help you more quickly and easily find and resolve validation errors when configuring an automation, you'll now see a banner in the configuration drawer alerting you if a validation error has occurred. 

- We've added an indicator of the last time identity data was updated to the **Identities** dashboard on the **Inventory** page. 

- We've been working hard behind the scenes to reduce the time it takes for a connector to sync. Among other performance improvements, you'll now experience a faster initial data sync when setting up a new application. 

### Fixed! 

- When **Max request duration** is enabled for an entitlement, **Indefinite** is no longer an option in the duration selector. 
</Update>
<Update label="October 10, 2025">

### Usability updates

* Campaigns and campaign templates can now be configured to automatically notify campaign owners and auto-generate a campaign report when the campaign ends. Find these controls on the campaign or template's **Configuration** tab. 

* You can now use a [CEL expression](/product/admin/expressions) to form a UAR campaign's list of users or accounts to be reviewed. 

* When scoping a UAR campaign by account parameters, you now have the option to include only accounts associated with [email domains that an admin has marked as trusted or internal to your organization](/product/admin/global-settings#set-trusted-domains), or only those domains external to your org.  

* On a campaign's **Tasks** tab, you can now filter the list of tasks by account type (user, system account, or service account). Additionally, the **Task** filter is now called **Task type** and allows you to zero in on review or revoke tasks. 

* To prevent backend issues with the source of C1 users, if your C1 tenant lacks at least one [directory app](/product/admin/directory/), you'll now see an alert on the admin dashboard. 

### Fixed! 

* We fixed issues that were preventing users with either the **Connector Administrator** user role or both the **Read-Only Admin** and **Basic User** user roles from completing their assigned tasks. 
</Update>
<Update label="October 3, 2025">

### Usability updates

* In lists of tasks, such as on the **Task log** page or on a campaign's **Tasks** tab, you'll now see a **Suspended** or **Deleted** chip next to the name of any task assignee whose C1 account is not active.  

* If an application has more than 10 resource types, you'll now find a dropdown resource type filter on the app's **Entitlements** tab, rather than quick filter buttons for each resource type. 
</Update>
<Update label="September 26, 2025">

### Usability updates 

* We've added more information about users as well as new manager, department, and job title filters to the user search and list-building modal. Access this modal by clicking **Show filters** on a user selection field.  

  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/product/assets/release-notes-26-sept-25.png" alt="A screenshot of a user selection modal, showing the managed by and job title fields in use."/>
  </Frame>

* Ready to delete an object like an application, connector, or access profile? You'll now be asked to confirm your action by typing the word "DELETE" rather than the full name of the object. 

* When setting up a **Revoke entitlements** step in an automation, you now have the option to revoke all entitlements. This option will create revoke tasks for all entitlements currently granted to the selected user. 

### Fixed! 

* When a limited-duration grant has expired, it is now shown on the user's **App catalog** page as requestable, rather than granted. 
</Update>
<Update label="September 19, 2025">

### Usability updates 

* When configuring a [policy rule that assigns a task to a group](/product/admin/policies#assign-for-review), you can now set a different group as the fallback reviewer. 

* On the **Users** page, you'll find new filters for sorting users by job title, manager, and department. 

* Notifications about expiring access are now more precise and show exactly how much time remains before the access expires. 

* Previously, we only showed the **Connectors** tab on an application's details page if more than one connector was configured for the app. But we've heard your feedback, and you'll now find the **Connectors** tab on every application details page. 

* Only active users are shown in the list of users a manager or admin can select from when requesting access for a colleague. 
</Update>
<Update label="September 12, 2025">

### Usability updates 

* To make access profiles easier to track and manage, we no longer enforce an entitlement's maximum grant duration, if set, when it's part of an access profile. Each full access profile is granted and managed as a single, consistent unit, and does not expire piecemeal. Maximum grant durations are still applied on individual grants.
</Update>
<Update label="September 5, 2025">

### Usability updates 

* To help you zero in on the users, accounts, or entitlements you're looking for, we've added a new **Show filters** option to select dropdown fields across the app. Click **Show filters** to open a selection experience with search and filter options that makes it easier to build a list of the assets you need. 

  <Frame>

  </Frame>

* We've made it easier to create a revoke task for a grant when access is no longer needed or appropriate:

   * Users can create a revoke task for their own unneeded access on the **Accounts** tab of their **Requests** page by clicking **View access**.

   * Managers can create revoke tasks for their direct reports on the **Accounts** tab of the **Requests** page by clicking **View access**.

   * App owners can create revoke tasks for access held by accounts in their app on the app's **Accounts** tab by clicking **View access**.

   <Frame>

   </Frame>

* Only users with the **Super Admin** role in ConductorOne can [move unmanaged apps to managed](/product/admin/applications#move-an-unmanaged-app-to-managed). 

* Application owners with the **Application Admin** role in ConductorOne can now add existing request forms to the entitlements in their apps. Only users with the **Super Admin** role can create new request forms and modify existing forms. 

* We made improvements to the input fields for the **Task action** automation step. You'll now find it easier to customize an automation to close or reassign the tickets concerning a user or assigned to a user. 

* Eagle-eyed users might have noticed that we're freshening up some key aesthetic details of the web UI. We won't list all our changes here (we'll leave them for you to discover!), but two we're especially pleased about this week are **colorful new avatars** for users and user app accounts, and a **progress bar** that's shown if you bulk submit a large number of campaign reviews. 

### Platform updates

* Use Terraform to link a new custom ConductorOne group to an existing IdP group so that ConductorOne matches and merges the two groups during the first sync of the IdP. Learn more and see an example script in the [Terraform docs](/developer/terraform#specialized-terraform-capabilities).

### Fixed! 

* We fixed the names of the bulk actions used for marking multiple grants deprovisioned. 
</Update>
<Update label="August 29, 2025">

### System management controls

On the new **System management** page in the **Settings** section, we've added controls that allow Super Admins to disable all Slack and email notifications, access profile membership automations, and automations for your ConductorOne tenant. 

Use one or all of these controls when a temporary pause in regular ConductorOne operations is necessary for testing, to prevent unintended consequences, or to perform critical maintenance. Check out [Temporarily disable system features](/product/admin/global-settings#temporarily-disable-system-features) for all the details. 

### Usability updates 

* You can now configure a policy step to wait for a set amount of time between one hour and one month, or until a specified time in the next 24 hours. To use these new options, select **Wait for** when editing a policy step, then select the **Duration** or **Time of day**. 

* We've added a field ID to each field in a request form so you can reference fields when [customizing external ticketing templates](/product/admin/external-ticketing#customizing-ticket-templates). 

### Platform updates 

* We've released a new version (1.0.18) of our [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ConductorOne/conductorone/latest), which adds list operations for all data sources. 
</Update>
<Update label="August 22, 2025">

### Request forms 

If you need requestors to answer questions or provide additional information when requesting certain entitlements, you can now create custom request forms that gather this data. Build request forms to gather precisely the information you need, and set them on one or many entitlements. Check out [Collect additional information from requestors using request forms](/product/admin/customize-requests#collect-additional-information-from-requestors-using-request-forms) to learn more and get started. 

### Automations updates 

* We've added two new automation trigger options: **Grant found** and **Grant deleted**. Set up these triggers to kick off an [automation](/product/admin/automations) whenever a specific type of change in a user's grants occurs. 

### Usability updates 

* On the **Applications** page's **Managed apps** tab, you'll now find a column showing the number of accounts in each app. 

* If an access profile does not yet have any members, no role mining recommendations are shown. 

* We swapped the order of columns on the **Connectors** page, so the links to connectors (instead of links to applications) are at the far left of the screen.
</Update>
<Update label="August 15, 2025">

### Automations updates 

* We've added a new automation trigger option: **Incoming webhook**. Set up this trigger to kick off an [automation](/product/admin/automations) whenever a certain action happens in a connected system. 

### Usability updates 

* Good news for anyone heading out on vacation this month: When [setting your own out-of-office delegate](/product/admin/delegate#set-your-own-delegate) you can now select a **Permanent** (ongoing) delegate or a **Temporary** delegate with specified start and end dates for the delegation period. 

* Assigned access request approvers and users with the **Super Admin** user role can now change the duration of a requested grant before approving the request. The change in duration will be noted in the task's audit log. 

  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/product/assets/release-notes-15-aug-25.png" alt="A screenshot of a request task in the ConductorOne UI, showing the duration field in its active edit state."/>
  </Frame>
</Update>
<Update label="August 8, 2025">

### Automations updates 

* We've added a new automation step option: **Send Slack message**. Use an [automation](/product/admin/automations) to send a message to a Slack channel when the automation's conditions are met. 

### Usability updates 

* You can now set whether delegation is allowed on individual policy steps. Set whether each step allows the task to be reassigned to the [delegate set by an admin](/product/admin/delegate#set-a-delegate-for-another-user) or a delegate [set by an individual user](/product/admin/delegate#set-your-own-delegate).

### Fixed! 

* We've fixed an issue that was preventing enrollment counts from updating properly after enrolled users were deleted. 

* If you change applications when setting user attributes, the list of available application attributes is now shown correctly. 
</Update>
<Update label="August 1, 2025">

### Role mining 

To help you construct well-scoped access profiles and identify overlaps in current access across groups of employees, we've introduced data-driven role mining recommendations in the access profile **Manage entitlements** drawer. ConductorOne automatically identifies apps strongly recommended for addition to an access profile as well as those that might be a good fit. Go to [Role mining recommendations](/product/admin/profiles#use-role-mining-recommendations) to learn more.

<img src="/images/product/assets/release-notes-1-aug-25.png" alt="A screenshot of an access profile's manage entitlements drawer, showing entitlements tagged with a recommendation to add or consider adding to the profile."/>
</Frame>

### Usability updates 

* Click on the chips at the top of each policy's details page showing the number of apps, entitlements, campaigns, and campaign templates the policy is applied on, and you'll open a drawer showing the details of where the policy is applied. 

* Connectors that support continuous sync (meaning that new data is synced as it becomes available, rather than on a set schedule) now have this capability indicated on their status chip. 

* Click a connector's **Connected** or **Error** status chip to quickly open the connector's log and sync history. 

* [ConductorOne groups](/product/admin/groups) and access profiles can now be included in conflict monitors. 

* When creating an access profile or setting an app’s standard audience and choosing the conditions for membership, you can now choose any entitlements (not just groups).

* When completing reviews using the **Review by app** view, you'll now find the entitlement's description printed at the top of the review section. 

* If you're editing a policy and navigate away without saving your changes, we'll ask you to confirm so you don't accidentally lose your work. 

* The JSON data returned from automation runs is now better formatted and easier to work with. 

### Fixed! 

* When doing a test run of an unused access automation, only accounts in the relevant app are available as test subjects. 

* We fixed an issue that was preventing the **Read-only** API client scopes from being displayed in some cases. 
</Update>
<Update label="July 25, 2025">

### A note on connector versions

We're in the process of upgrading our older connectors from [v1 to v2](/baton/migration) to improve performance and enable long-term support. While your existing v1 connectors might be marked as deprecated, they are still supported. No action is needed at this time unless you encounter a non-critical issue, in which case we may guide you to migrate. 

### Unused access automations

The new **Unused access** section on each app's details page lets you see and manage app accounts that have not been used recently, and that might be good candidates for revocation. Click **Account unused > 30 days** to view the list of accounts in that state. 

You can also set up tailored unused access automations from this section to notify, revoke, or perform the actions of your choice when access is not used within a specified timeframe. Go to [Unused access automations](/product/admin/automations#unused-access-automations) to learn more. 

### Usability updates 

* Use the new `UserType` enum with the new `type` property in [CEL expressions](/product/admin/expressions) to focus on certain user types (human, agent, service, or system). For example, `subject.type == UserType.SERVICE` can be used to locate all service accounts. 

* To help you know how policies are being used across your ConductorOne tenant, we've added a count to the top of each policy's details page showing the number of apps, entitlements, campaigns, and campaign templates the policy is applied on.

  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/product/assets/release-notes-25-july-25.png" alt="A screenshot of the top of a policy details page, showing that the policy is applied to 3 apps, 2 entitlements, 75 campaigns, and 2 campaign templates."/>
  </Frame>

* You can now include Markdown tables in campaign instructions, access request instructions, and task comments.  

* When you make a request on the **Requests** page's **App catalog** tab, a drawer now pops open to show you the newly created request task. 

* Disabled and suspended users are no longer shown as options when [setting your own out-of-office delegate](/product/admin/delegate#set-your-own-delegate). 

### Fixed! 

* The edit button for an application's description is now visible even when the description is extremely long. 

* When automatically deprovisioning an account, all steps in the policy are performed. 

* Clicking **Next user** in a by-user campaign correctly loads the next set of reviews.
</Update>
<Update label="July 18, 2025">

### Automations updates 

* We've added a new automation step option: **Grant entitlements**. Use an automation to grant a user one or more entitlements when the automation's conditions are met. 

* App-specific automations can be created and managed by application owners who also have the **App Admin** user role. You can create, view, and manage these automations on the application page's **Automations** tab. Go to [App-specific automations](/product/admin/automations#app-specific-automations) to learn more. 

### Usability improvements

* On the **Applications** page's **Unmanaged apps** tab, we've made two key improvements: 

  * Use the new **Parent app** filter to show only the child apps of a particular IdP, SSO, or federation provider. 

  * Select multiple apps and move them in bulk to the **Managed** state. 

* Tasks for apps with last login information now have a color-coded clock icon to provide at-a-glance insight into how recently a user signed into the app. 
</Update>
<Update label="July 11, 2025">

### Introducing automations 

We're thrilled to introduce [automations](/product/admin/automations), a powerful new feature designed to dramatically streamline your operational processes within ConductorOne. Build custom workflows to handle repetitive tasks, reduce manual effort, improve compliance, and achieve greater efficiency. 

Automations are ideal for:

* Kicking off critical processes based on employee status changes
* Providing seamless onboarding experiences
* Ensuring secure and efficient offboarding
* Managing role transfers with ease
* Automating timely access reviews

Explore these new capabilities on the **Automations** page!

### Inventory page 

This new page in the **Explore** section gives you a comprehensive, single-pane-of-glass view of all your resources and identities synced to ConductorOne. You'll also get insight into key sensitive credentials like API tokens and service account keys from select integrations. 

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/assets/inventory.png" alt="A screenshot of the Inventory page, showing the Identities tab with the service accounts filter engaged."/>
</Frame>

With easy-to-use sort and filter tools on each tab, you can quickly pinpoint the exact information you need. Visit [View identities, resources, and secrets](/product/admin/inventory) to learn more. 

### Requests page improvements 

* We've redesigned the **Profiles** tab on your **Requests** page, making it easier to see which profiles and associated entitlements you're assigned and can request.

* A new filter on the **App catalog** tab lets you quickly view the apps you currently have access to, the apps available for you to request, or all of the above. 

### Usability improvements

* You asked, and we've delivered: you can now add and change application icons. Check out [Upload a custom app icon](/product/admin/applications#upload-a-custom-app-icon) for details. 

* When you replace a file, you'll now see information on the name of the previously uploaded file and the date when it was uploaded.  

### camelCase CEL expressions

We are adopting camelCase for all [CEL expressions](/product/admin/expressions), and moving away from snake_case. This change will make writing and reading CEL expressions in ConductorOne more consistent, and is intended to improve the overall developer experience. You don't need to modify any expressions you're using today, but new expressions should be written in camelCase. 
</Update>
<Update label="June 27, 2025">

### Usability improvements

* You can now duplicate and edit an existing policy if you don't want to start from scratch. Go to [Duplicate an existing policy](/product/admin/policies#duplicate-an-existing-policy) to learn more.

* If you've completed all your assigned tasks in an open campaign, the campaign is moved to the bottom of the list on your **Access reviews** page. 

### Fixed! 

* You can successfully edit the scope of a campaign template. 

* Conflict monitor names no longer have a 20-character maximum length.
</Update>
<Update label="June 20, 2025">

### App account deprovisioning

By default, ConductorOne automatically sets the account deprovisioning process based on your app's provisioning configuration. To customize deprovisioning, go to the app's **Controls** tab and [set how app accounts are deprovisioned](/product/admin/access-requests#set-how-app-accounts-are-deprovisioned).

### Usability improvements

* Entitlement and application descriptions are now shown on the **App catalog** page. 

* You can now format campaign instructions using Markdown to add emphasis, links, and structure. 

### Fixed! 

* Editing campaign templates with a large number of resources and entitlements is now faster and more reliable.

</Update>

### Fixed! 

* We've repaired an issue that was preventing the orphaned accounts explorer query and security dashboard card from populating correctly. 

</Update>
<Update label="June 6, 2025">

### Streamline access request configuration

The new [standard audience](/product/admin/access-requests#set-the-standard-audience-for-an-app-and-select-requestable-entitlements) setting on an application lets Application Admins and Super Admins quickly make specific entitlements within the application requestable to everyone in your organization or to select groups, without the need to set up an access profile. 

### Usability improvements

* You can now provide app-specific instructions to end users who are requesting new access. 

  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/product/assets/access-request-instructions.png" alt="Two screenshots side by side, with the left one displaying the Instructions field on an app being filled out, and the right one showing those instructions on the Request access form."/>
  </Frame>

* Any connector that pulls data from an external data source now shows a **Sync now** button and an option to view the connector's logs on the application details page and in the list of connectors.

* If an app has linked entitlements to be set up, you'll now see a banner on the app's details page. 

* App population reports now display more relevant and helpful information. For example, the name of a role is now shown instead of the entitlement name "member". 

### Fixed!

* The names of unmanaged apps are now automatically updated when the corresponding apps' names change in the IdP. 

* Deleted access profiles are no longer included in the access summaries shown on an app's **Entitlements** tab. 

* You can successfully rename an access profile.

* We've added clearer error messaging to a task's **Audit log** when a `waiting for app user assignment` provisioning error occurs. 

* Users no longer receive an email or Slack notification for each new entitlement they are granted when enrolled in an access profile.  

### Fixed!

* The full list of an app's linked entitlements is shown, instead of only the first 50. 

* You can now successfully delete steps in an account provisioning or deprovisioning configuration. 

</Update>
<Update label="May 23, 2025">

### Vaults 

Our new **Vaults** feature allows you to securely manage and distribute the initial passwords for application accounts provisioned through ConductorOne.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/assets/vaults-2.png" alt="A vault's details view, showing three credentials."/>
</Frame>

Configure a vault on the **Vaults** page in the **Settings** menu, then direct an application configured for automatic account provisioning to deposit newly created account passwords in the vault. Only the vault owner and the new account's owner can decrypt the new credential. Go to [Vaults](/product/admin/vaults) to learn more and get started. 

### Guiding you forward 

In our continuous effort to create a more intuitive experience, we're making some key adjustments to navigation and naming. 

* We've merged the **Manage access** page and all its features into a new one-stop-shop **Requests** page. Go to this page to submit a new access request, track the requests you've made for yourself or others, complete your request tasks, review your app accounts, and manage your temporary access.

  <Frame>
  <img src="/images/product/assets/release-notes-23-may-25.png" alt="The end user Requests page showing the Assigned to me tab with four tasks."/>

* When setting up a policy that allows reassignment of tasks, you now have the option to limit which users a task can be reassigned to. Only the members of the reassignment allowlist will be available when a user reassigns a task.

* You can now set a default access review view on a campaign or template. The default view setting (by app, by user, or unstructured) will open every reviewer's access reviews in the view you select, but reviewers can switch to a different view, if desired. 

* Open tasks are now automatically canceled when a key object is deleted. When a user is deleted, their grant requests are canceled. When a grant is revoked, access reviews concerning it are canceled. When an entitlement is deleted, both grant requests and access reviews for it are canceled. 

* Super Admins now have the option to skip a step in a task from the **...** (more actions) menu. 

### Platform updates 

* We've added two new associated IP addresses: `52.33.197.26` and `54.68.132.142`. All ConductorOne IP addresses are listed at the top of the [Connectors overview and FAQ doc](/baton/faq/). 

* A new field, `user.username`, has been added to the User object and can be referenced in condition expressions.

* We've released a new version (1.0.3) of our [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ConductorOne/conductorone/latest). 

### Fixed! 

* Name changes to access profiles are now shown correctly throughout ConductorOne. 

* The **Generate report** button is no longer displayed if a user does not have permission to generate reports. 

* When requesting access, the **Which entitlements?** dropdown now returns matching resources as well as entitlements.

* Application owners can only delete the apps that they own. 

* The ConductorOne Slack app now shows a more helpful error message if a search for apps returns more than 100 results.

* We fixed an issue that was preventing the successful scoping of campaigns by unused access. 

</Update>

<Update label="April 18, 2025">

### Request access upgrades 

On the **Request access** form, you'll now find **Basic app access** and **All other entitlements** combined within the **Which entitlements?** dropdown. Save time and clicks by requesting both app access and one or more specific entitlements in a single request. 

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/assets/release-notes-18-apr-25.png" alt="Request access form showing both app access and a specific entitlement in the entitlements field, and a highlight on the Create link control."/>

### Usability improvements 

* You might have noticed the **Task log** table stating that a page displayed "1 - 100 of more than 100" tasks. While technically correct, "more than 100" wasn't very helpful, so you'll now find the full task count instead.

* On the **Manage access** page, we've added an **Accounts** tab listing all your application accounts with their status, user roles, and last login information, as available. If you're managing access for another user, use this tab to quickly view a summary of their current accounts. 

* You can now use Markdown formatting in comments on tasks to make your notes to other ConductorOne users as bold, italicized, or linked as you'd like. 

* If the user who is the subject of an access review task is deleted after the campaign has started but before the task has been completed, that task is now automatically canceled. 

* When an external ticket for a provisioning assignment created by ConductorOne is resolved, this is now noted in the associated task's audit log. 

* On the **Users** tab, you can now download a custom report of the full users list or a filtered selection. 

### Fixed! 

* When writing CEL expressions to configure account provisioning, enter `subject.attributes.CUSTOM USER ATTRIBUTE` to reference a custom user attribute you've set up in ConductorOne. (This replaces the `subject.profile.CUSTOM USER ATTRIBUTE` syntax used previously.)

* You can successfully apply multiple filters to the **Task log** page.

### Condition expressions

We've expanded the ConductorOne CEL expression language with user, task, task analysis, IP, and IP CIDR objects to support more sophisticated policy and group condition expressions.

Check out our docs on [condition expressions](/product/admin/expressions) to learn more and to see sample expressions for use cases such as "route a request based on how it was created", "check whether a request will cause an access conflict", and "route a request based on whether the access is requested permanently or temporarily". 

### Bulk actions

Two new bulk actions are here to help you work more efficiently in ConductorOne:

- Revoke multiple users' access to an entitlement by navigating to the **Entitlements** tab and clicking the **Grants** count. 

- Set the owner or owners of multiple entitlements in an app on the **Entitlements** tab. 

### Connectors 

- We improved our support for Slack Enterprise installations with multiple workspaces.

- The JumpCloud integration now creates a **JumpCloud Administration** application in ConductorOne, and assigns all JumpCloud administrators in your organization to that app.

- When requesting access on the **Request access** page or in the Slack app for a ConductorOne user who has multiple accounts in the selected application, you are now asked to select which account needs access.

- If access is granted indefinitely, the email notification of new access no longer includes information about the length of the grant's duration.

**Fixed!**

- When access is granted for a limited time, the amount of time remaining for the grant is now shown correctly in email and Slack notifications.

<Update label="September 22, 2023">

**Usability improvements**

- When requesting access on the **Browse access** page for a ConductorOne user who has multiple accounts in the selected application, you are now asked to select which account needs access.

- A new **SSO configuration** section is now shown on the **Settings** page. When SSO is enabled for your ConductorOne tenant, the SSO provider in use is shown here.

- Because Salesforce users can include a company's customers, the Salesforce integration no longer syncs several non-employee user types.

**Fixed!**

- You can now successfully send the assigned user a reminder to complete an open revocation task.

- An error message is no longer displayed while a request catalog is loading.

- Only the user for whom new access is requested, or that user's manager, can escalate an open access request task to emergency access.

- The counts of open tasks shown in the **My work** section of the navigation panel are now more accurate.

- If an uploaded file does not contain any data, it is not accepted by the connector, and a single error is printed to the connector log.

**Fixed!**

- CrowdStrike app accounts now display the correct account status.

</Update>
<Update label="September 8, 2023">

**New integrations.** Joining the integrations library this week are [Broadcom SAC](/baton/broadcom-sac) and [Cortex XSOAR](/baton/xsoar). These new integrations are in early access while we gather feedback and fine-tune their details. If you're keen to try them out, let us know!

**Reset campaign policies.** If during the process of building an access review campaign you've made changes to the policies to be applied to entitlements in the campaign, you can now use the **Reset policies** control on the campaign scoping tab to reset the policies to their defaults. Resetting recreates all campaign selections so that each uses the policy inherited from (in order of precedence) the entitlement's configuration, the application's configuration, or the campaign's configuration.

**Usability improvements**

- The campaign reports page now has clearer status labels and click-to-copy file hashes.

- We've added a select-all checkbox control to the **Edit campaign entries** modal.

**Fixed!**

- We fixed a bug that was preventing the generation of some campaign reports.

- Requests for new access made on behalf of another user now correctly show the user's name in request notification emails instead of the requester's name.

- When you search for an application by name on the **Browse access** page, rerequestable entitlements that do not match your search string are no longer hidden from view.

</Update>
<Update label="September 1, 2023">

**New integrations.** This week we're welcoming [LDAP](/baton/ldap), [ServiceNow](/baton/servicenow), and [CrowdStrike](/baton/crowdstrike) to our integrations library. If you're ready to get started with one or more of these integrations, let us know. We'll be happy to help get you set up!

**Access request user roles.** To support teams administering access requests in ConductorOne, we've launched **Access Request Helpdesk** and **Access Request Administrator** user roles. Any user assigned one of these roles can create an access request ticket on behalf of any other user. Access Request Administrators can also create and manage request catalogs. Go to [Assign user roles](/product/admin/user-roles/) to learn more.

**Usability improvements**

- You are no longer required to retype the name of a user whose access is being fully revoked.

- We've added loading animations and more helpful messaging to the **Browse access** page.

**Fixed!**

- Previously, the list of entitlements shown in a dropdown or search result in the web app was limited to 100 entries. We've removed that limit, and you'll now see the full list of available or matching entitlements.

- The Last Modified date and time for a file uploaded from a datasource is now shown correctly.

</Update>
<Update label="August 25, 2023">

**Updated integrations.** We're pleased to announce the general availability of our [Jamf](/baton/jamf), [Bitbucket](/baton/bitbucket), [Box](/baton/box), [PagerDuty](/baton/pagerduty), [Zoom](/baton/zoom), and [Tableau](/baton/tableau) integrations.

</Update>
<Update label="August 18, 2023">

**Docs site refresh.** As you've probably noticed, we gave the docs site a little aesthetic upgrade this week by consolidating fonts, dialing back our use of color, and lightening font weights. We think the result feels cleaner and lighter, and we hope you like it too!

**Fixed!**

- The **Request Emergency Access** button on applicable task details pages has been returned to its proper location.

- We've added the links to documentation for the six new integrations announced last week.

- We fixed a bug that was allowing deleted application accounts to be erroneously included in campaigns.

</Update>
<Update label="August 11, 2023">

**New integrations.** We're pleased to introduce [Jamf](/baton/jamf), [Bitbucket](/baton/bitbucket), [Box](/baton/box), [PagerDuty](/baton/pagerduty), [Zoom](/baton/zoom), and [Tableau](/baton/tableau) to our integrations library. These new integrations are in early access while we gather feedback and fine-tune their details. If you're eager to get started with one or more of these integrations, let us know!

**Updated browse access experience.** For our Access Requests customers, we're proud to introduce the redesigned **Browse access** page. Use this page to see all the apps and resources available for you to request, understand your current access, and view your open access requests. Managers can also request new access for their team members from this page. To learn more and get started, check out [Browse current and available access](/product/how-to/create-requests).

**Usability improvements**

- If you create a request for emergency access when you already have an open request for non-emergency access to the same app or resource, you'll now see a `duplicate ticket` error with a link to the original request. This makes it easier to escalate the original request to emergency access rather than creating a duplicate request.

- ConductorOne now pulls in more key account data from OneLogin, including manager, title, company, and department.

</Update>
<Update label="August 4, 2023">

**Usability improvements**

- When you set an entitlement's provisioning strategy to manual provisioning, you have the option to include instructions for the provisioner. These instructions are now shown in the task details view and in the provisioning assignment Slack message.

- We've added an explanatory message to the email digest for open campaigns that do not have any open tasks.

**Fixed!**

- We've greatly reduced the load time in Slack for the list of rerequestable entitlements from a large request catalog.

- If the same entitlement is included in more than one of your available request catalogs, Slack no longer lists the entitlement multiple times.

</Update>
<Update label="July 28, 2023">

**Emergency access requests.** We've added emergency access requests to ConductorOne in order to support IT and security teams' need to quickly gain access to key resources in order to respond to emergencies such as production outages. You can now choose which entitlements can be requested during an emergency and build dedicated emergency access policies to use during the expedited approval process. Go to [Enable emergency access requests](/product/admin/emergency/) for more on setting up emergency access requests for your team.

**Cone, the ConductorOne command line interface (CLI).** If the command line is your happy place, we've got you covered. Use `cone` commands to manage the full access request workflow: view available entitlements, request access, drop access when it's no longer needed, review access requests, and much more. Check out the [Cone docs](/product/cli/install) to learn more and get started.

**Usability improvements**

- When searching for a resource name, such as when building a catalog or campaign, the search now returns all of the resource's associated entitlements.

- You can now sort a table of tasks by task number by using the caret in the column header.

- Searches for policies and applications are no longer case-sensitive.

**Fixed!**

- If you've set your digest emails to be delivered on a weekly cadence, they'll now arrive labeled "Weekly Digest" instead of "Daily Digest".

</Update>
<Update label="July 21, 2023">

**Usability improvements**

- By default, lists of tasks are now sorted by task ID, with the most recently created task at the top.

- The App ID is now shown on each application's details page.

Check out the documentation to get started with these integrations, and let us know what else you'd like to see added to the integration library!

</Update>
<Update label="July 7, 2023">

**New integration.** We're excited to add [1Password](/baton/1password) to our library of integrations. The 1Password integration uses our Baton connector to pull usage data from your 1Password instance. Check out the docs to learn more and get started using 1Password with ConductorOne.

**Usability improvements**

- The task details page now displays all known attributes for the app account whose access is being reviewed or changed. Use the arrow control to open or close the account attributes panel.

- A **Reassignments** column is now included on all newly generated campaign reports, showing whether each access review task was reassigned and to whom.

- If no request policy is set on either an entitlement or its application, the Auto-Generated App Owner Approval Policy is now used on requests for that entitlement.

- If no revocation policy is set on either an entitlement or its application, the Default revocation policy is now used when revoking that entitlement.

**Fixed!**

- Changes to an [entitlement slug](/product/admin/managing-entitlements) are now always saved and reflected correctly.

</Update>
<Update label="June 30, 2023">

**Usability improvements**

- When submitting an access request, justification is now required.

- We made some improvements to the specificity of error messages.

</Update>
<Update label="June 23, 2023">

**Usability improvements**

- You can now only revoke an account's access to an entitlement if you are the account owner's direct manager, the application's owner, or the entitlement's owner. Anyone who attempts to revoke a grant without one of these relationships will see an error: `User does not have permission to request access on behalf of another user`.

**Fixed!**

- We've fixed some issues with digest emails that were causing them to arrive in some cases without their title or footer info.

</Update>
<Update label="June 16, 2023">

**Fixed!**

- You can now successfully request access to an entitlement for an "indefinite" amount of time.

- The Panther integration now pulls and maps SAML external roles correctly.

- We've fixed an error that was causing some time-limited access grants to not be automatically revoked on expiration.

</Update>
<Update label="June 9, 2023">

**Email digest of your open tasks.** We all know that notification emails can quickly go from a help to a burden. That's why we're delighted to introduce a new digest format that summarizes all your open ConductorOne tasks in one quick email. Digest emails can be sent to all ConductorOne users at your organization who currently have open tasks either every weekday or once per week, so you can set the cadence that's best for you and your colleagues. Go to [Email digest notifications](/product/admin/notifications) to learn more and get set up.

**New integrations.** This week we welcome [UKG](/baton/ukg), [Panther](/baton/panther), and [CloudAMQP](/baton/cloudamqp) to our integrations library. These new integrations are in early access while we gather feedback and fine-tune their details. If you'd like to use one or more of these integrations, let us know! We'd be delighted to get you set up.

**Usability improvements**

- We've improved the design and clarified the messages shown on a task's details page summarizing the planned action and outcome of reviews, provisioning steps, and deprovisioning steps.

- Error messages in provisioning and deprovisioning steps now link to the audit log.

- When requesting access to a specific resource on an app, the general app access resource is no longer shown in the list of options.

**Fixed!**

- We've fixed an issue that was causing account types that were manually set on application accounts to be reset by the system.

</Update>
<Update label="June 2, 2023">

**Usability improvements**

- You can now designate application accounts as system accounts on the application's **Accounts** page.

- ConductorOne now supports two new columns in uploaded spreadsheets and CSV files:

  - **User type** to designate whether each account is a user account, service account, or system account
  - **Account owner** to automatically map the account owner to the correct ConductorOne user by matching email addresses

**Fixed!**

- We resolved an issue that created a `request context cancelled` error when building a campaign.

- Email links to your access review tasks now direct you a page where you can select how you want to view your reviews, rather than to an old version of the unstructured view.

</Update>
<Update label="May 26, 2023">

**Usability improvements**

- We've made it easier to publish and unpublish request catalogs, and added a confirmation screen with additional details when you take one of these actions.

- Each request catalog's current publication status (**Published** or **Draft**) is now shown on the **Catalogs** page.

- We gave all the modals a little visual refresh, and we think they're looking quite spiffy in their new blue header banners.

</Update>
<Update label="May 19, 2023">

**Campaign creation upgrades.** Our revamped user access review campaign creation flow is now generally available. We redesigned the way you sort, find, and choose the resources and entitlements included in your campaigns, streamlining the process for busy UAR admins. Many thanks to everyone who provided feedback and helped us to refine this experience!

**Usability improvements**

- If you have more than one Docusign account, you can now specify the Docusign API Account ID when setting up an integration so that the correct account's data is pulled into ConductorOne.

**Fixed!**

- You can now successfully set a time limit for an entitlement even if the entitlement is not included in any request catalogs.

- ConductorOne now reads the Okta attribute `managersEmail` as a source for the Manager user attribute.

- When you searched for a user's name in a dropdown field (such as when adding an owner to an app), your search input remained in the field even after you found and selected the right user from the list. We've fixed this.

- Slack notifications of overdue campaign tasks no longer show negative time remaining before the due date.

</Update>
<Update label="May 12, 2023">

**Directories and user attribute mapping.** We're pleased to announce that these two features are now generally available, and send our thanks to all our users who provided feedback and helped us refine them. [Setting your directory apps](/product/admin/directory) as the sources of truth for employee data is a key step in setting up ConductorOne. [User attribute mapping](/product/admin/attributes) helps you to ensure that key employee data is pulled into ConductorOne correctly so it can be used to add context or narrow scope as needed.

**Request access.** The **+ Request access** page in the navigation panel is now generally available for our Access Requests customers. Use this simplified form to request new access for yourself or the folks you manage with a few clicks. Check out [Request access to apps and resources](/product/how-to/create-requests) to learn more.

**Request catalogs.** Also for Access Requests customers, we've updated the request catalog creation screen. You can now publish and unpublish saved catalogs, as well as update who can request the items in the catalog, all from the catalog's page.

**Navigation panel.** We spruced up the navigation panel this week, including collapsing the lower sections by default to streamline navigation, refreshing the icons, and getting rid of the all-caps section headers. THOSE ALWAYS SEEMED A BIT SHOUTY.

**Usability improvements**

- You can now upload files of up to 256MB to ConductorOne.

- Your choices when setting campaign parameters now include key user attributes such as Manager, Department, and Job Title.

</Update>
<Update label="May 5, 2023">

**Usability improvements**

- We've added a resource type column and the ability to filter by resource type to the application **Groups** and **Roles** tabs.

- The JumpCloud integration now supports nested group app assignments.

</Update>
<Update label="April 28, 2023">

**Usability improvements**

- When setting up a Salesforce integration, you now have the option of telling ConductorOne to use Salesforce usernames (which are formed as unique email addresses) as email addresses, rather than the contents of the Salesforce email field. This setting helps ConductorOne to properly sync Salesforce service accounts, which often all use `noreply@salesforce.com` as their email address.

**Fixed!**

- Entitlements from apps sourced via an IdP are now correctly provisioned or deprovisioned by the connector.

- Users with the Campaign Owner role can now add entitlements to campaigns.

</Update>
<Update label="April 21, 2023">

**New integrations.** This week's new arrivals to the integration library are [Duo](/baton/duo) and [NetSuite](/baton/netsuite). These integrations are both in early access as they settle in and we gather feedback. If you'd like to give one or both a try, let us know!

**Revoke granted entitlements.** Navigate to an entitlement and click the **Grants** tab to view all users who currently have the entitlement, and to revoke these grants if necessary. Clicking **Revoke** on a grant and filling out the revocation form creates a revocation request that will use the relevant app- or entitlement-level revocation policy. The task will be sent to any required approvers, and then the access will be either automatically or manually deprovisioned.

**Fixed!**

- Clicking a Groups, Roles, or Resources breadcrumb now returns you to the correct tab on the application's main page.

- We fixed an issue with rate limiting that prevented Docusign users from syncing correctly.

- We resolved an error that kept AWS S3 buckets in the `us-east-1` region from integrating successfully.

- Some connectors displayed a **Connected** status badge once they were set up but before any integration credentials were added, which was especially confusing for integration owners. We've fixed this, and connectors now show a **Not connected** badge until credentials are successfully added and a sync is complete.

</Update>
<Update label="April 14, 2023">

**A new organization of your application and resource information.** Your application pages now have a new design, organized so that your application, resource, and entitlement data are more intuitively nested. On each application's main page you can view (and in many cases, edit) application details such as the application's owners, governing policies, cost per seat, and data sources. You'll also find new tabs that break out the groups, roles, and other resources present in the application. (If you prefer to see everything together in a single list, use the Entitlements tab.) Click into any resource on the Groups, Roles, or Resources tabs to see and edit the resource's details and the specific entitlements that can be granted to users. Click an entitlement to reach the final layer, where you can edit the entitlement's details and associated attributes, set entitlement-level policies, and more.

**Delegate a user's tasks.** If you want to avoid sending ConductorOne tasks or notifications to a certain user, such as an executive or a colleague who is out on leave, you can now set a delegate to whom that user's tasks will be automatically reassigned. Check out [Delegate a user's tasks](/product/admin/delegate) to get started with this new feature.

**New and updated integrations.** We're pleased to announce that the [Cloudflare Zero Trust](/baton/cloudflare-zero-trust) and [Sentry](/baton/v1/sentry) integrations are now generally available. Check out the documentation to get up and running with these integrations. We've also added [Asana](/baton/asana), [Expensify](/baton/expensify), [Linear](/baton/linear), and [Slack](/baton/slack) integrations, which are all in early access while we gather more feedback. Let us know if you'd like to add any (or all!) of these new integrations to your Integrations page.

**Fixed!**

- The correct count of resources is now shown on the Resources tab for Google Cloud Platform.

- Empty resource and entitlement names are no longer allowed, which prevents mysterious disappearances.

- The `test.salesforce.com` domain is now accepted when setting up a Salesforce connector.

</Update>
<Update label="April 7, 2023">

**Sign up for ConductorOne using JumpCloud for SSO.** You can now configure an OpenID Connect (OIDC) app in JumpCloud that will enable single-sign-on access to ConductorOne for your users. To get started, go to [Sign up using JumpCloud](/product/how-to/qs-set-up-c1#authenticate-with-jumpcloud).

**Usability improvements**

- You can now delete connectors. On the connector's details page, click the more actions (**...**) menu and select **Delete**.

</Update>
<Update label="March 31, 2023">

**JumpCloud integration.** The latest addition to our integration library is JumpCloud. This new integration is currently in early access, so contact us if you'd like to add it to your **Integrations** page.

**Usability improvements**

- Your **Reviews** page now displays a progress bar for your assigned tasks in each campaign, and the campaigns are sorted by due date.

- Any resource description that has been updated from its default state is now displayed in the resource selector when requesting access.

- Clearer error messages are now shown in Slack if something happens to an access request between the time when it is assigned to you and when you take action.

**Fixed!**

- Once an import from a data source successfully starts or errors, the import modal closes automatically.

- When filtering by multiple roles on the **Users** page, any user with multiple selected roles is only shown once.

</Update>
<Update label="March 17, 2023">

**Fixed!**

- The user profile attributes job_title, department, and status are now pulled from Google Workspace.

- The user profile attribute employmentStatus is now pulled from BambooHR.

- Attributes used in your directories are now shown correctly as options when mapping user attributes.

</Update>
<Update label="March 10, 2023">

**Assign review and access tasks to a group.** You can now assign review and approval tasks to any group in any app integrated with ConductorOne. All members of the group will receive notification that a task needs their attention, and any member can complete the task. Get started with group approvals by adding a step to any policy and selecting **Group** as the reviewer.

**Google Identity Platform integration.** Good news, Google Identity Platform users: we now have an integration that pulls and syncs Google Identity Platform user data with ConductorOne. This new integration is currently in early access, so contact us if you'd like to add it to your **Integrations** page.

**Fixed!**

- The comment modal now opens correctly when a reason is required for approval of a user's access and the reviewer clicks **Certify**.

- When setting up a Snowflake connector, the **User role** field now accepts input correctly on the first try.

</Update>
<Update label="March 3, 2023">

**Fixed!**

- Users assigned the integration owner role can now only see and edit the integration details for their assigned connectors. Super administrators can still see and edit all connectors.

- The GitHub connector no longer shows a `sync_users: failed fetching external users` error if you do not have SAML enabled.

- You can now successfully set up the Snowflake connector without getting a `failed to parse 'Account ID / Locator'` error.

- Options in the more actions (**...**) menu on **My work** area task pages are no longer unresponsive. The modals for each menu option now open properly.

</Update>
<Update label="February 24, 2023">

**Usability improvements**

- Who approves the approvers? If you request access to an app or resource that you are an approver for, your request is now automatically approved. However, if the request policy governing the app or resource doesn't allow self-approval, you'll still need another user to manually approve your request.

- If an automated step in a task (such as automated connector provisioning or deprovisioning) isn't completed because of a system error, the error is now shown on the relevant step in the task's details view.

- When setting up a Slack channel for a campaign, ConductorOne now checks to see if the channel name you've entered already exists in your Slack instance. If the channel exists, ConductorOne will invite reviewers and send campaign notifications in that the Slack channel instead of creating a new one.

**Fixed!**

- You can successfully sort a task view by account while the list of tasks is filtered by a resource type.
- The number of grants in Zendesk groups is shown correctly.

</Update>
<Update label="February 17, 2023">

**Delegate integration setup to an integration owner.** When you're working on integrating a new application with ConductorOne, you can now tap your company's resident expert in that app to create and enter all the relevant credentials.

The new delegated integration owner workflow starts with an admin setting up the integration and naming an integration owner to finish the process. ConductorOne notifies the integration owner by email that their help is needed to complete the integration setup, and directs them to the relevant page. Check out the docs for any integration to learn more about how the process works.

**Usability improvements**

- The messages that pop up at the top of your screen to confirm an action or let you know there's a problem are now more specific to the work you're doing.

- New columns displaying the application name and the resource type are now included in all task tables.

- We added a message explaining the situation if there are no applications available to request.

- In the Tasks table, we replaced the due date column with a column showing the current state of each task.

- If access to an application or resource is asked for or granted for a limited time, the length of access is now shown in the relevant Slack messages.

**Fixed!**

- Sometimes a list of options in a dropdown showed more than one choice with the same name. We've added more context to those choices so you'll be able to tell the difference and select the one you need.

- Info drawers are now correctly shown in front of modals when both are open at the same time.

- If an application name was created using double spaces, the app name was displayed with only a single space. If you tried to delete the application and typed in the name as displayed--with single spaces--you received an error because despite what it showed you, ConductorOne expected the name of the app to contain double spaces. Phew. This is now fixed.

</Update>
<Update label="February 10, 2023">

**Google Cloud Platform connector no longer syncs empty roles.** The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) connector no longer syncs roles that do not have any grants. This change is necessary because by default, each GCP project contains roughly 1,000 roles. Removing empty roles from the sync significantly improves the performance of the connector and the usability of the entitlement data it pulls into ConductorOne. If you want to include an empty GCP role in your access review, assign a service account to the role before creating the campaign.

**Fixed!**

- When reassigning a task to another user, the user selection dropdown now correctly displays user names.

- Users with the Basic User user role can now successfully request access to new tools and resources.

- File mapping settings are now preserved and implemented correctly when you upload a new version of a file.

</Update>
<Update label="February 3, 2023">

**Data value mappings for imported data.** When you import application data using a CSV file or an Excel spreadsheet, ConductorOne attempts to match the data values in your file to the data values the system expects. We're pleased to introduce a new mapping interface that's designed to make it easier to reconcile the data output by your application and the data model used by ConductorOne. Check out the new mapping interface by uploading a file to a new or existing application and then clicking **Set Mappings**.

**Usability improvements**

- We've improved the search autocomplete experience across ConductorOne, making it easier for you to find what you're looking for.

- The progress bar on your list of access review tasks now shows the number of tasks competed, rather than the percentage.

- On pages in the **My work** area where every entry in the task type or current state column was always the same, we removed the redundant columns.

- A user's job title and department is now displayed in list views, if that information is available to ConductorOne. If not, the user's email address is shown instead.

- You can now include account profile attributes in your file imports to pull in more data about your application accounts to ConductorOne.

- Tasks that you've acted on but that are assigned to you for a subsequent step are now shown in your tasks list. Only tasks on which no further action is currently required from you are shown as completed tasks.

**Fixed!**

- If a task uses a policy that requires an entitlement owner's approval, but no entitlement owner is assigned, the task now shows a **No assigned user** message instead of getting stuck in a pending state.

- You can now successfully add an entitlement that does not have a display name to a request catalog.

- The option to bulk approve open tasks is now hidden when viewing only completed tasks.

</Update>
<Update label="January 27, 2023">

**Application and entitlement details pages.** We've redesigned the details pages for applications and entitlements so you have more visibility and edit control from a single screen. See all of an application's data sources in a single pane, manage application and entitlement owners, update default policies, record per-seat application costs, set entitlement provisioning behavior, and much more.

**Usability improvements**

- The Sentry connector now pulls and syncs your Sentry user roles.

- The purpose of the bulk **Complete reviews** button wasn't immediately clear, so we rewrote the button label. It now shows the number of reviews that are left to be completed in the current list, which we hope will make the bulk action control a bit clearer.

- We standardized our policy type terminology across the application, removing certify and approve in favor of review and request.

- Users with the Basic User role can no longer cancel their assigned tasks unless the subject of the task's account has been deleted.

</Update>
<Update label="January 13, 2023">

**Sync an integration on demand.** Integrations pull info from the source application once an hour by default, but there are times when you might want to start a sync immediately, or stop an in-progress sync and restart the process. We've added a new **Sync now** control to each connector, giving you the power to sync the latest app info on demand.
