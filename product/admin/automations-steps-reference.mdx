An automation needs at least one step, and can have as many steps as you need. You can reorder steps if needed by using the arrow controls.

### Send Email

Sends an email notification to specified recipients. This step is useful for alerting stakeholders about important events, such as notifying IT admins when a new employee joins or when access needs to be reviewed.

**Required fields:** Recipient, Email title, Email subject, Email message

**Example:** Send an email to three IT admins

### Send Slack Message

Posts a message to a designated Slack channel. This step enables real-time notifications to teams and can be used to keep relevant channels informed about workflow events, new access grants, or other important updates.

**Required fields:** Slack channel name, Message

**Example:** Send a Slack message to the "new-employees" channel

### Wait for Duration

Pauses the automation workflow for a specified period of time before continuing to the next step. This is useful for implementing delays, such as giving users time to respond to notifications or allowing time for manual review before automated actions are taken.

**Required fields:** Time to wait before proceeding

**Example:** Wait 30 minutes

### Create Campaign

Automatically creates a new access review campaign based on a template. This step is particularly valuable for ensuring timely access reviews when significant events occur, such as when an employee departs or changes roles.

**Required fields:** Access review template, User whose access will be reviewed

**Example:** Create a new UAR campaign to review a departed user's access

### Revoke Entitlements

Creates revoke tasks to remove specified entitlements from a user's account. You can selectively revoke access while excluding certain entitlements that should be preserved. This is essential for offboarding workflows and managing access changes.

**Required fields:** Target user, Entitlements to revoke, Entitlements to exclude

**Example:** Create revoke tasks for all AWS entitlements except app access

### Grant Entitlements

Automatically grants specified entitlements to a user. This step streamlines onboarding and role change processes by ensuring users receive the appropriate access permissions without manual intervention.

**Required fields:** Target user, Entitlements to grant

**Example:** Grant access to the "Engineering team" role in Jira

### Modify Delegate

Updates or removes delegation settings for a user. This is useful when managing temporary access delegation or when a user's responsibilities change and their delegated tasks need to be reassigned.

**Required fields:** Target user

**Example:** Remove this user as a delegate

### Remove Access Profiles

Unenrolls a user from specified access profiles. This step is important during offboarding or role transitions to ensure users no longer receive automatic access grants associated with profiles they should no longer be part of.

**Required fields:** Target user, Access profiles to unenroll from (or check the box to unenroll from all)

**Example:** Unenroll the user from three key access profiles

### Modify User Status

Changes a user's status in ConductorOne (e.g., to Active, Disabled, or Inactive). This step helps maintain accurate user records and can be used to disable accounts when employees leave or take extended leave.

**Required fields:** Target user, New user status

**Example:** Change a user's status to Disabled in ConductorOne

### Run Automation

Triggers another automation to run. This allows you to create modular workflows and chain automations together, enabling complex multi-step processes while keeping individual automations focused and maintainable.

**Required fields:** Automation name, (Optional) Context in JSON format

**Example:** Trigger a run of the "Secondary Offboarding Tasks" automation

### Perform Task Action

Takes action on existing tasks, such as reassigning, completing, or canceling them. This step is valuable for managing task workflows when users change roles or leave, ensuring that pending tasks are properly handled.

**Required fields:** Whose tasks to take action on, Task type, Action to take

**Example:** Assign all a user's open review tasks to the head of Security

### Run Webhook

Executes a configured webhook to integrate with external systems. This step enables ConductorOne to trigger actions in other platforms, creating seamless integrations with your broader technology ecosystem.

**Required fields:** Webhook name, Payload

**Example:** Trigger a webhook that creates a ticket to deprovision Figma access

### Perform Connector Action

Executes custom capabilities configured on a connector. Connector actions extend automation functionality with app-specific operations that may not be available through standard steps. Contact Customer Success to learn more about setting up connector actions.

**Required fields:** Connector name, Action name, Additional fields as determined by the connector action's format

**Example:** Lock an Active Directory account

### Create Account

Creates a new account in a connected application. You can choose between two creation methods: **Custom** (which uses connector-specific schema as described in the [automatic account provisioning documentation](https://www.conductorone.com/docs/product/admin/account-provisioning)) or **From ConductorOne user** (which uses existing user information from ConductorOne to populate the new account). This step automates account provisioning during onboarding.

**Required fields:** Connector name, Creation method, Additional values depending on method

**Example:** Create a new Greenhouse account

### Call Function

<Info>
  The Call Function step is currently in early access. Contact your technical account manager to learn more about enabling this feature for your workspace.
</Info>

Executes a custom function with specified input parameters. Functions allow you to extend automation capabilities with custom logic, data transformations, or complex operations that aren't available through standard automation steps. Functions can process data, perform calculations, make decisions based on custom business logic, and return values that can be used in subsequent automation steps.

**Required fields:** Function name, Input parameters

**Example:** Call a function to calculate prorated access costs based on user start date
