## How does ConductorOne's helpdesk automation work? 

If your organization's IT service desk wants to keep its current processes and toolchain, but needs to automate approval and provisioning workflows on the backend, ConductorOne’s AI-powered Copilot can manage approval routing and provisioning behind the scenes.

When your colleague request access by creating a service desk ticket, Copilot automatically turns the information in the ticket into a request task in ConductorOne. As the request task proceeds through the approval and provisioning steps in ConductorOne, Copilot updates the Jira ticket, maintaining a full audit trail. 

## Integrate your Jira Service Management instance

<Tip>
**ConductorOne currently supports Jira Service Management.** 

The instructions below set up an integration with **Jira Service Management** that allows ConductorOne Copilot to create, modify, and resolve Jira service desk tickets. 

If you want to connect a **Jira Cloud** instance with ConductorOne so that you can review Jira access data and grant user access to Jira, go to [Set up a Jira Cloud connector](/baton/jira).
</Tip>

The integration process includes setup tasks in both ConductorOne and Jira Service Management. We'll guide you through the process.  

In ConductorOne:

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Service desk integrations**.
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Add integration**. 
</Step>

<Step>
Select your service desk provider and set a display name for the integration.
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Save**. Next, you'll need to install the ConductorOne app in Jira Service Management. 
</Step>
</Steps>

In Jira Service Management: 

<Steps>
<Step>
Click **Apps** > **Manage apps** > **Settings**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enable **Private listings**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Upload app**. 
</Step>

<Step>
In the **From this URL** field, enter the following: 

   ```
   https://marketplace.atlassian.com/files/1.1.0-AC/e87e112f-5c07-462d-a57a-d3cd0fd3840f
   ```
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Upload**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Finally, copy the base URL of your Jira Service Management instance (for example, `https://example.atlassian.net`). 
</Step>
</Steps>

Back in ConductorOne: 

<Steps>
<Step>
Click **Edit** and paste the base URL of your Jira Service Management instance into the **URL** field. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Done**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Configure Copilot settings 

Once the integration is set up, you'll see the option to configure how Copilot will work in your Jira Service Management instance. 

<Steps>
<Step>
Click **Edit** to open the editing panel. 
</Step>
<Step>
To enable ConductorOne Copilot to create, update, and resolve Jira Service Desk tickets for you, click to turn on **Activated**. 

<Tip>
   **Set up automation to add the `c1` label.**
   
   When Copilot is activated, it will automatically process all Jira tickets with a `c1` label in the project you specify as access request tickets. Make sure to set up automation in Jira Service Management to add this label to the appropriate tickets. 
</Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>


<Steps>
<Step>
In the **Jira project** field, select the project where you want to use Copilot. 
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you want Copilot to only act on tickets from a specific request type, select it from the **Jira request type** dropdown.
</Step>
<Step>
To turn on automatic submission of any valid access request processed by Copilot, enable **Auto-submit requests**. Invalid requests will still be routed to a member of your organization for manual review and processing.  

   If you leave this option disabled, all requests will be submitted for manual review before proceeding. 
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** In the **Field level hinting** section, help Copilot correctly extract the information from Jira tickets to create access requests by mapping ConductorOne access request attributes to the ticket fields in Jira where the information should be pulled from. 

   <Tip>
      **Field type limitations.** 
      
      ConductorOne can only pull data from custom Jira fields of these types: 

      * Single select
      * Radio buttons
      * Single line text
      * Cascading select

      Jira ticket fields that use a different field type cannot be used, and will not be shown in the ticket field selection dropdown. 
   </Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Steps>
<Step>
In the **Jira ticket status for resolved requests** field, select the Jira ticket status that you want Copilot to automatically set when a request ticket is complete in ConductorOne. 
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** In the **Resolved state mapping** section, set how you want ConductorOne closed request task status to map to Jira ticket resolution states. 

   ConductorOne sets each closed request task to one of the following statuses:

   * Granted (the access was approved and provisioned)
   * Denied (the access was not approved)
   * Canceled
</Step>
<Step>
Finally, in the **Flagging tickets** section, set a label that Copilot will automatically apply to Jira tickets in need of manual intervention. 

   Set up filters or workflows in Jira Service Management to pull tickets with this label into your team's work queue. 
</Step>
<Step>
When you've finished making your selections, click **Save**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your service desk integration is ready to use.
