## Default user roles

The person who initially sets ConductorOne up for your company is given the **Super Administrator** role. After that, all users who sign into ConductorOne for the first time are automatically given the **Basic User** role. Read more about these and the other available user roles below. 

You can keep these roles as-is, or assign new roles depending on what each user needs to get done. Users can have more than one role, and a user is granted all the permissions of every role they're assigned.

## Assign a new user role to a user

You can change any user's role assignment on the **Users** page. Users can have more than one role, and a user is granted all the permissions of every role they're assigned.
