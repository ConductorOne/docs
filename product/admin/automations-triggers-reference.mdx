Each automation can be triggered by an event such as the creation of a new application account or a change in a user or account's status. Alternatively, you can skip adding an automation trigger and instead run the automation manually.

### On demand (no trigger)

This option creates an automation with no automatic trigger, meaning it will only run when manually executed by an administrator. This is useful for ad-hoc tasks that need to be performed on demand rather than in response to specific events or on a schedule. Automations without triggers can be run manually from the automations list or triggered programmatically by other automations using the "Run Automation" step.

**Required fields:** None (trigger is manual execution only)

**Example:** Create a manual cleanup automation that can be run as needed to review and remove stale access

### User updated

This trigger activates when a specified attribute of a user changes in ConductorOne. You can monitor changes to employment status, department, manager, or any other user attribute. Optional conditional expressions allow you to narrow the trigger to specific changes, such as when a user's status changes from "Active" to "Terminated."

**Required fields:** User attribute, (Optional) Conditional expression

**Example:** Trigger on a change to a user's employment status

### Account created

This trigger fires when a new account is created in a specified application. It's useful for initiating onboarding workflows, sending welcome notifications, or ensuring new accounts receive appropriate access. Conditional expressions can further refine when the trigger activates based on account properties.

**Required fields:** App name, (Optional) Conditional expression

**Example:** Trigger on the creation of a new GitHub account

### Account updated

This trigger activates when a specified attribute of an account changes in a connected application. You can monitor changes to account properties like email address, account status, role assignments, or other account-specific attributes. This is valuable for maintaining consistency across systems or responding to important account changes.

**Required fields:** App name, Account attribute, (Optional) Conditional expression

**Example:** Trigger on a change to the email address associated with an Okta account

### Unused access

This trigger activates when a user has not logged into their app account for the specified duration. It's essential for maintaining security hygiene by identifying and addressing unused access. You can configure how to handle accounts with no login activity recorded and set cold start behavior to determine whether existing unused accounts are immediately processed or only newly unused accounts trigger the automation.

**Required fields:** App name, Days since last login, (Optional) Type of account, (Optional) Whether to include accounts with no login activity, (Optional) Conditions for inclusion/exclusion, Cold start behavior

**Cold start behavior:** Sets whether app accounts that meet the unused access condition when the automation is first enabled will immediately have the automation's actions performed, or if the automation should proceed only after a delay (during which time you could, for example, alert the impacted users that their access will be removed if unused).

**Example:** Trigger when a user has not logged into GitHub for 45 days

### User created

This trigger fires when a new user is created in ConductorOne, typically through directory synchronization. It's ideal for initiating onboarding automations that grant initial access, send welcome communications, or create accounts in various systems. Conditional expressions allow you to target specific types of new users based on their attributes.

**Required fields:** (Optional) Conditional expression

**Example:** Trigger when a new user is created

### Grant found

This trigger activates when a new access grant is discovered in your environment. It's useful for monitoring when users receive new permissions, ensuring compliance with access policies, or triggering additional provisioning steps. You can filter by specific entitlements, applications, and how the grant was created (manually, through automation, via access request, etc.).

**Required fields:** Account type, Entitlements or app name, Grant source, Grant type, Grant origin

**Example:** Trigger when a user is granted access to the OpsGenie on-call rotation

### Grant deleted

This trigger fires when an access grant is removed from a user's account. It's valuable for maintaining access consistency across related systems, triggering cleanup tasks, or alerting stakeholders about access removal. You can specify which types of grants to monitor based on entitlement, application, and how the grant was originally created.

**Required fields:** Account type, Entitlements or app name, Grant source, Grant type, Grant origin

**Example:** Trigger when a user loses access to their Google Workspace account

### Incoming webhook

This trigger enables external systems to initiate ConductorOne automations by sending webhook requests. It's essential for integrating ConductorOne with your broader technology ecosystem, allowing events in other systems (like HRIS platforms, ticketing systems, or custom applications) to trigger access management workflows. You must configure authentication to ensure only authorized systems can trigger the automation.

**Required fields:** Authentication method (HMAC or JWT)

**Example:** Trigger when an employee's status changes to Inactive in Workday

### Schedule for user

This trigger runs the automation on a scheduled basis for specified users. You can configure the frequency (daily, weekly, monthly) and select which users the automation should run for. This is useful for periodic access reviews, recurring compliance checks, or regular housekeeping tasks that need to be performed on user accounts at set intervals.

**Required fields:** Schedule frequency, Target users

**Example:** Run a weekly access review automation for all contractors

### Schedule for app user

This trigger runs the automation on a scheduled basis for users of a specific application. Similar to the Schedule for User trigger, but scoped to app-specific accounts. You can configure the frequency and select which app users (or filter by account properties) the automation should run for. This is valuable for app-specific maintenance tasks, periodic access validations, or recurring compliance checks on application accounts.

**Required fields:** Schedule frequency, App name, Target app users

**Example:** Run a monthly unused access check for all Salesforce accounts

## Requestable automation triggers

Requestable automations use an **On demand** trigger, which means they run only when explicitly requested by a user through the Actions catalog. Unlike event-based or scheduled triggers, requestable automations are initiated through a user-facing request form and governed by approval policies.

When you configure an automation as requestable, it cannot have other trigger types (such as User Updated, Account Created, or Schedule triggers). The automation remains dormant until a user submits a request, at which point it proceeds through the configured approval workflow before executing its steps.

For more information about configuring requestable automations, including how to set up request forms, approval policies, and audience scoping, see the [requestable automations documentation](https://www.conductorone.com/docs/product/admin/automation-actions).
