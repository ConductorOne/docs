## Access explorer queries

To query your access data, navigate to **Admin** > **Explore** > **Search**. 

On the **Access explorer** page you'll find pre-built queries to help you explore and understand your organization's access data so you can mitigate potential security risks. Here's an overview of the available queries and the ways you can filter them to zoom in on the data that matters most to you.  

| Query title                                 | What the query shows                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Available filters                               |

## Security dashboard

To help you quickly and easily track high-risk and sensitive access, the results of select access explorer queries are also summarized on the **Security** dashboard. Click a dashboard card to be directed to the query results page where you can view the data in more detail, filter the results (when filters are available), and create and download reports. 

To access the security dashboard, navigate to **Admin** > **Dashboard** and click the **Security** tab. 

The security dashboard shows quick summaries of the following categories: 

* **Orphaned accounts** - All accounts for all applications with either no account owner or a deactivated user set as the account owner.

* **High-risk accounts** -  Accounts granted at least one entitlement designated [high risk](/product/admin/global-settings#set-attribute-values).                                                                

* **Inactive accounts (past 30 days)** - Accounts with no activity for the past month. 

* **High-risk role grants (permanent)** - All users granted a role designated [high risk](/product/admin/global-settings#set-attribute-values) with no expiration on the grant.

* **Standing privileges** - Users with access grants that have no time limit.  

* **High-risk role grants (temporary)** - All users granted a role designated [high risk](/product/admin/global-settings#set-attribute-valuess) with a time limit on the grant.
