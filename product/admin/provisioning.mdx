Provisioning is hard! (And complicated.) We're identity people, we know. 

ConductorOne supports multiple methods for provisioning access. This allows you to add governance and access control to all of your apps and technologies.

We'll walk you through the different methods for provisioning, from simplest to most sophisticated, and when to use each one.

## Method 1: Connector provisioning

<Tip>
**When to use?** 

Direct provisioning is the default provisioning strategy for apps with a connector.
</Tip>

This is the easiest method. Provisioning-enabled ConductorOne connectors complete the provisioning process directly, without any input needed from you. ConductorOne can provision fine-grained entitlements and permissions directly in the connected application or infrastructure. By default, ConductorOne will use the connector when provisioning or deprovisioning access. To determine if a connector supports provisioning, see the connector's documentation.

## Method 2: Linked entitlements

<Tip>
**When to use?**

Use linked entitlements if the application is in your SSO directory or identity provider and you need basic access control.
</Tip>

ConductorOne allows you to manage the apps from your SSO directory or identity provider. Once these apps are managed, ConductorOne will discover "linked entitlements". These are entitlements in the SSO directory or identity provider that have a relationship with the application. 

Examples of linked entitlements:

- In Microsoft Entra, several groups are assigned to the application for access control.
- In Okta, several push groups are used to SCIM group memberships to the app.
- In Okta, AWS access is controlled using custom attributes that are added to the SAML assertion at login time.

In each example above, access is "controlled" by assigning the user to the entitlement (such as group membership) in the SSO directory or identity provider.

ConductorOne allows you to manage provisioning in the downstream app by creating the linkage between that managed app in ConductorOne and the SSO directory or identity provider.

To use this method, first ensure that app is managed by ConductorOne:

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the **Applications** page.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **Unmanaged apps** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Find the app and click **Manage**.
</Step>
<Step>
Set the app owners and click **Manage**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

Next, configure the linked entitlements:

<Steps>
<Step>
On the **Managed apps** tab, click the app you just managed.  
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **Entitlements** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **Linked entitlements** icon at the top right corner of the entitlements table (it looks like a Venn diagram).
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Linked entitlements** drawer, either create new roles or resources in ConductorOne that map to those entitlements, or map those to existing roles or resources (if you've already added a connector to the app).
</Step>
</Steps>

Once set up, ConductorOne will provision the entitlement by provisioning the "linked" entitlement in the SSO directory or identity provider. This is transparent to the end user.

## Method 3: Manual provisioning

<Tip>
**When to use?**

Use manual provisioning as a last resort. Nobody likes touching provisioning requests.
</Tip>

Manual provisioning treats the provisioning step as if ConductorOne were a ticketing engine. The provisioning task is assigned to one or more users to complete the provisioning. 

Manual provisioning can be configured by clicking the provisioning settings on an entitlement. 

<Warning>
If there is an error or issue in provisioning, manual provisioning is used as the fallback method. In this scenario, the request is assigned to the application owner to resolve the issue.
</Warning>

## Method 4: Ticket-based provisioning

<Tip>
**When to use?**

Use ticket-based provisioning if you need access requests to flow through your helpdesk.
</Tip>

ConductorOne supports helpdesk ticket creation as a method for provisioning access. To use ticket provisioning, you'll first need to add a connector that supports ticket provisioning. Examples of ticketing-enabled connectors are [Jira](/baton/jira/) and [ServiceNow](/baton/servicenow/). 

Once a connector with ticketing is added, configure how ConductorOne will create tickets in the system (see [External ticketing](/product/admin/external-ticketing) for instructions), then set provisioning to use the external ticketing option. Once set up, a helpdesk ticket will be automatically created any time provisioning is required. ConductorOne will track the progress of the helpdesk ticket and update or close the provisioning task accordingly. 

## Method 5: Webhook provisioning

<Tip>
**When to use?** 

Use a webhook if you want to quickly add provisioning for a homegrown app, or if you need to add custom logic in your provisioning workflow.
</Tip>

To set up webhook provisioning:

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Webhooks**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Follow the instructions in [Using webhooks](/product/admin/webhooks/) to set up a new webhook endpoint. 
</Step>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, click **Applications**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select an application and click **Entitlements**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **...** (more actions) menu for your selected entitlement and select **Edit provisioning**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Configure provisioning** drawer, select the **Webhook** provisioning method. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select your webhook from the dropdown. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Method 6: Multi-step provisioning

<Tip>
**When to use?** 

If you have multiple steps for provisioning access, such as "put the user in an IdP group, then directly provision the entitlement in another application".
</Tip>

Custom provisioning allows for significant flexibility when it comes to provisioning access. Multi-step provisioning allows you to perform a series of steps for provisioning access, such as "send a webhook and then create a helpdesk ticket and then directly assign the permission in the app".

To configure multi-step provisioning: 

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, click **Applications**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select an application and click **Entitlements**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **...** (more actions) menu for your selected entitlement and select **Edit provisioning**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Configure provisioning** drawer, use the **Add step** controls to add as many provisioning steps as are needed. Make sure to add the provisioning steps in the order you want them to be applied. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Deprovisioning 

The process of **deprovisioning** (removing a user's access) is automatically handled by ConductorOne and generally mirrors the configured provisioning method.

By **default**, ConductorOne attempts to infer and perform the **inverse action** of the configured provisioning method for an entitlement. For example:

* If the provisioning method is **Connector provisioning**, the system will attempt to use the connector to directly deprovision the entitlement in the target application. (Not all connectors support deprovisioning, see the connector's docs for details.)
    
* If the provisioning method is **Linked entitlements**, the system will remove the linked entitlement in the SSO directory or identity provider.

* If the provisioning method is **Ticket-based provisioning**, a helpdesk ticket will be created to initiate the removal of access.

### Set a custom deprovisioning flow for an entitlement

You have the option to set a specific deprovisioning flow that is different from the provisioning method for any entitlement.

This is useful if the steps required to remove access are different or more complex than the steps used to grant access.

To configure a custom deprovisioning flow for an entitlement:

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, click **Applications**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select an application and click **Entitlements**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the name of an entitlement to go to its details page. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Deprovisioning** section of the page, click **Edit**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select your desired deprovisioning method, and configure the selected method. 
</Step>
<Step>
Use the **Add step** controls to add as many deprovisioning steps as are needed. Make sure to add the deprovisioning steps in the order you want them to be applied. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>
