## Provide instructions to requestors

You can set instructions on each application that will be shown to users when they request new access in the web UI or in Slack.

</Frame>

<Tip>
A **Super Admin** or an application owner with the **Application Admin** role in ConductorOne must complete this task. 
</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Applications**.
</Step>

<Step>
On the **Managed apps** tab, select an application. 
</Step>

<Step>
Locate the **Access requests** card and click **Edit**. 
</Step>

<Step>
Add app-specific request instructions to the **Instructions** field. You can format your instructions using Markdown to add emphasis, links, and structure. 
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Save**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Users requesting entitlements in this app will be shown your instructions. 

## Collect additional information from requestors using request forms 

You can set up customized request forms that require requestors to provide additional information when making an access request in the web UI. (Request forms are not currently supported in Slack.)

</Frame>

Adding request forms to your access requests allows you to collect specific, contextual information from users when they request access. This helps IT and security teams make informed decisions, automates workflows, and supports compliance efforts. 

Request forms can help with: 

* **Financial tracking**: Require users to provide a project name or cost center so access can be accurately allocated and billed.

* **Compliance and licensing**: Ask for the user's country or region to ensure they are assigned the correct software licenses and permissions in line with local regulations and licensing agreements.

* **Onboarding**: A manager requesting access for a new hire can provide the new employee's start date in a request form. This lets the IT team pre-stage accounts and resources, ensuring everything is ready for day one.

* **Change management**: Require a ticket number or link. This ties the access request directly to an existing change management process, providing an audit trail for all approved permissions.

If [external ticketing](/product/admin/external-ticketing) is configured, information gathered by a request form will be included in provisioning tickets created in the ticketing system. You can also use the field ID automatically assigned to each request form field when [customizing external ticketing templates](/product/admin/external-ticketing#customizing-ticket-templates).

### Add a request form to an entitlement

<Tip>
A **Super Admin** or an application owner with the **Application Admin** role in ConductorOne must complete this task. 
</Tip>

Request forms are set on individual entitlements, so users are asked for information specific to the access they're requesting. Request forms can be reused across apps and entitlements in ConductorOne, so you don't have to create them from scratch each time.

To add an existing request form to an entitlement:

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Applications**.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Managed apps** tab, select an application, then click the **Entitlements** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Locate and click on the name of an entitlement you want to add a request form to. 

</Step>
<Step>
On the entitlement's details page, locate the **Access requests** section and click **Edit**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Request form** section, use the dropdown to select an existing request form that will be applied to this entitlement. 
</Step>
<Step>
When you're ready, click **Save** to apply your chosen form to access requests for the entitlement. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** The request form will now be shown whenever a user requests this entitlement via the **Requests** page or the **+ Request access** page. 

### Add a request form to several entitlements in an app 

You can use a bulk-actions shortcut to set the same request form on multiple entitlements: 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Applications**.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Managed apps** tab, select an application, then click the **Entitlements** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Use the checkboxes on the left of the screen to select the entitlements that you want to add the request form to, then choose **Set access requests** from the bulk actions menu at the bottom of the table. 
</Step>
<Step>
Find the **Request form** area at the bottom of the configuration drawer and select the request form you want to apply to these entitlements. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Submit**.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** The request form will now be shown whenever a user requests one of the selected entitlement via the **Requests** page or the **+ Request access** page. 

### Create a new request form

<Warning>
A **Super Admin** in ConductorOne must complete this task. 
</Warning>

When designing and setting up request forms, remember that each entitlement can use only one request form at a time. 

To create a new request form:
<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Applications**.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Managed apps** tab, select an application, then click the **Entitlements** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Locate and click on the name of an entitlement you want to add a request form to. 
</Step>
<Step>
On the entitlement's details page, locate the **Access requests** section and click **Edit**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Request form** section, use the dropdown to select **Create new**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the new form a name and description. 


   Remember that this form will be available as an option across your ConductorOne installation, so choose a name that will help your colleagues understand the form's purpose. 
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** If you want to hide the default **Justification** field when this request form is in use, click to enable **Hide justification field**. If you leave this disabled, the **Justification** field will be included in the request form.  
</Step>
<Step>
Select the data type for your first field. The current options are: 
* Text (a single-line text field)
* Checkbox 
* Text area (a multi-line text field)
* Dropdown 
</Step>
<Step>
Fill in the field label and provide dropdown options, helper text, a default value, and a placeholder, as needed. The required and available elements vary by field type. Here's an overview of how and where these elements are shown in the access request:

   <Frame>
   <img src="/images/product/assets/custom-forms-2.png" alt="A screenshot showing a request modal on the Requests page with a request form showing the three field types. Each field element is labeled with its type: the text field's field label reads Text field label, the placeholder value is Placeholder, and so on."/>
   </Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
For text and text area fields, choose whether the field is required. A user cannot submit a request if a required field has not been filled out. 

<Tip>
**ConductorOne will always gather required information.** If a request is created without collecting the required information, the request task will be assigned to the user so they can provide the required information before the request approval process begins. This can happen when a request is created in Slack (which does not currently support request forms), or when multiple entitlements are requested at once. 
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step>
As needed, click **Add field** and repeat the steps above to add additional fields. 
</Step>
<Step>
When you're satisfied, click **Save**. 
</Step>
</Steps>
   
**That's it!** The newly created request form is automatically added to the entitlement where you created it. Follow the steps above to add this request form to other entitlements. 

### Modify a request form 

<Warning>
A **Super Admin** in ConductorOne must complete this task. 
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Applications**.
</Step>

<Step>
On the **Managed apps** tab, select an application, then click the **Entitlements** tab.
</Step>

<Step>
Locate and click on the name of an entitlement. 
</Step>

<Step>
On the entitlement's details page, locate the **Access requests** section and click **Edit**. 
</Step>

<Step>
In the **Request form** section, use the dropdown to select an existing request form.
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Modify** to review and alter the selected form. 
</Step>

<Step>
When you're ready, click **Save** to exit the editing drawer.  
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your changes to the form will be pushed to all entitlements currently using the form. The count of these entitlements, if relevant, is shown in a banner at the bottom of the drawer.
