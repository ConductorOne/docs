## Enable or disable all email notifications for your tenant

ConductorOne can send notifications by email to members of your organization about their tasks and access. On the **Notifications** page, you can configure whether these emails are sent out or not. 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Notifications**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Set the **Email notifications** toggle to the enabled or disabled position, as desired.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your email notification settings do not impact whether notifications are sent via Slack or Microsoft Teams. 

## Send digest emails

Enable email digest notifications to automatically send users a daily or weekly summary of their open tasks and expiring access. Admin users also see a list of connector sync errors and deactivated app, entitlement, and resource owner issues. 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Notifications**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Make sure that **Email notifications** is enabled.
</Step>
<Step>
Set the **Email digest** toggle to **Yes, send email digest**.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose the email digest frequency. You can send email digests every weekday, or weekly on Tuesdays. In either case, emails are sent between **9AM and 10AM Pacific time**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Any user who has at least one open task will now receive a digest at the email address associated with their ConductorOne user.
