## View campaign progress

On the **Overview** tab of any running campaign, view a dashboard of the campaign's progress and metrics.

<Frame>
![A screenshot of the Overview tab of a campaign in ConductorOne, showing the campaign's progress and metrics.](/images/product/assets/campaign-dashboard.png)
</Frame>

On this dashboard, you can:

* Get a summary of the campaign's progress and open tasks
* Track reviewer approval rates and average review time
* Remind reviewers to complete their open tasks
* Track review completion status by application
* View a burndown chart of the campaign's remaining open reviews over time

## View and manage individual reviews

On the campaign's **Tasks** tab, you can filter the list of campaign tasks, open individual access reviews' details panes, and take action:

- Complete any tasks assigned to you
- See the status of the access review (completed, open)
- See the outcome of the access review (approved, denied)
- Reassign the review, if necessary
- Restart the review, if necessary
- Send the assigned reviewer a reminder notification
- Add comments
- View audit log history
- View related tasks

You can also generate a CSV report of all tasks in the campaign by clicking the **Generate CSV** icon at the top of the **Tasks** table. Your report will be prepared and posted in the downloads center at the top of the page when ready.

## View review submissions 

On the **Submissions** tab, you'll find a log of review submissions by the reviewers assigned to complete tasks in your campaign. Each line in the submission log includes the submission date (hover over for an exact timestamp), and the count of submitted reviews, broken down by certifications and denials. 

<Tip>
**What's the difference between the submitted reviews and successfully submitted columns?** Occasionally there can be a discrepancy between the reviews submitted by a reviewer and the official record of the reviews submitted to the campaign. Reasons for this kind of discrepancy include errors in review processing, or situations such as when multiple reviewers are assigned to the same review and another reviewer submits a decision first. 
</Tip>

Click the **Generate CSV** icon above the log to generate a downloadable report of all submission data. 

## Send notifications

ConductorOne automates the process of notifying users about their open access reviews, reassignments, and impending deadlines.

<Tip>
**Make sure that notification emails reach you:**

Add [no-reply@conductorone.com](mailto:no-reply@conductorone.com) to your email contacts list.
</Tip>

### Automatic notifications

If the Campaign Owner has enabled campaign notifications, these notifications are sent automatically:

| Notification                         | Time sent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### On-demand notifications

To help remind users to complete their campaign access reviews, a Campaign Owner can also send the following notifications on demand at any time during the campaign:

| Notification                          | Sent to                                                       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Complete your access reviews reminder | All users currently who have uncompleted access reviews in the campaign. | <p>A campaign-wide reminder. <br/></p><p>Triggered by clicking <strong>Send reminders</strong> on the main campaign page. </p>                                                     |
| Complete this access review reminder  | The user currently assigned to a specific uncompleted access review.      | <p>A reminder sent to one individual about one task. </p><p></p><p>Triggered by clicking <strong>...</strong> > <strong>Send reminder</strong> in the task details view. </p> |

## End the campaign

Campaigns do not end themselves, even if their scheduled end date has passed. A Campaign Owner or someone with the Super Administrator user role must end the campaign.

Click **End campaign** to finish and close an active campaign. Here's what happens next:

- If any reviews are outstanding, ending the campaign cancels those requests.

- When ending the campaign, you'll be asked if remaining open reviews should be **Skipped** or **Revoked**.

- The completed campaign is automatically archived on the **Completed** tab on the **Campaigns** page.

Depending on the size of the campaign, ending it might take some time. You'll see a notification popup alerting you when the campaign ending process begins, and another when it's complete. 

Once a campaign is complete, the configuration and access reviews for the campaign cannot be changed. However, you can still view and [generate reports](/product/admin/manage-campaigns#generate-a-campaign-report) for the campaign.

## Revoke access that was denied during the campaign
{/* header name used in links, change with caution */}

Once the campaign ends, you can manually start the process of revoking access to the entitlements that were denied during the campaign.

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the campaign's details page.

</Step>
<Step>
On the **Access reviews** tab, use the **Status** filter to show only tasks with a **Denied** status.

</Step>
<Step>
If access has already been revoked, an **Access revoked** message is shown in the task's **Outcome** column. If this column is blank for a task, you can revoke the access manually.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **...** (more actions) menu for the task and select **Revoke access**. A revocation task is created.
</Step>
</Steps>

Depending on the revocation policy set on the entitlement, the task might require review and approval before the access is removed by either an automatic or manual process. ConductorOne will create and assign the tasks as appropriate.

<Tip>
**Add a revocation step to your campaign's review policy to automate this process.** 

To automatically kick off a revocation flow for any access denied during the campaign, add a post-execution step to the review policy used on the campaign. See [Add followup tasks](/product/admin/policies#step-4-add-post-execution-actions) to learn more.
</Tip>

## Generate a campaign report
{/* header name used in links, change with caution */}

Access review campaigns have built-in reports that show the progress and prove the outcomes of the campaign. Reports can be generated at any time after a campaign has started. Campaigns and campaign templates can also be configured to auto-generate a campaign report when the campaign ends. 

To generate a report:

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Campaigns**.

</Step>
<Step>
On the **Running** or **Completed** tab, locate and click the name of the campaign you're interested in.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Reports** > **Generate report** and confirm your action.
</Step>
<Step>
The report is compiled for you. Depending on the size of the campaign, this might take several minutes, so please be patient.
</Step>
<Step>
When the report is ready, click **Download** to receive the report in Excel format.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Verify report hashes

If you need to verify the checksum of a downloaded report for auditing purposes, here's what to do: 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Campaigns**.

</Step>
<Step>
Click the name of the campaign you're interested in.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Reports**. You'll see the file hashes for each report you've generated. 
</Step>
<Step>
If necessary, download the report. 
</Step>
<Step>
On the command line, navigate to the directory where the downloaded report file is stored. Run the commands appropriate to your operating system, subbing in the name of the downloaded report for \<FILENAME\>. 

   **Windows**

   ```bash
    CertUtil -hashfile <FILENAME> MD5
    CertUtil -hashfile <FILENAME> SHA256
    ```

    **Linux**

    ```bash
    md5sum <FILENAME> 
    sha256sum <FILENAME>
    ```

    **MacOS**

    ```bash
    md5 <FILENAME> 
    shasum -a 256 <FILENAME>
    ```

</Step>
<Step>
Compare the output of the commands with the file hashes printed on the **Reports** page. The checksums will match if the downloaded file has not been altered.
</Step>
</Steps>
