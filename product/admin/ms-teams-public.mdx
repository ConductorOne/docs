## What can I do with the ConductorOne Microsoft Teams app? 

Use ConductorOne's Microsoft Teams app to interact directly with ConductorOne without leaving Microsoft Teams. Once the ConductorOne Microsoft Teams app is installed for your workspace, you and your colleagues can:

- Get notified when an open access request needs your approval 
- Approve or deny access requests without leaving the Teams interface
- Receive notifications if a connector has a sync issue or a significant drop in synced resources
- Request new access without leaving the Teams interface

## Set up the ConductorOne MS Teams app on an individual workstation

If a Teams admin at your organization has not automatically added the ConductorOne app to your organization's Teams interface, you can set it up on your workstation yourself. Here's what to do:

</Steps>
**That's it!** You're set up and ready to work with ConductorOne from the comfort of your Teams interface.
