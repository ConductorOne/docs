## What are ConductorOne groups? 


<Frame><img src="/images/product/assets/conductorone-groups.png" alt="A screenshot of the ConductorOne app showing a sample ConductorOne group."/></Frame>

ConductorOne groups are collections of ConductorOne users that you create and use within ConductorOne. These groups are resources in [the ConductorOne app](/product/admin/c1-for-c1). 

## What can I do with a ConductorOne group? 

Key uses for these special groups include: 

* **Organizing employees without creating custom IdP groups.** ConductorOne groups make it easy to create groups of employees who share key profile attributes or combinations of access. 

* **Specifying who is granted an access profile.** An access profile can be requestable by, or automatically assigned to, a ConductorOne group. 

* **Assigning a group as reviewer on a policy step.** A ConductorOne group can be set as a policy step reviewer. 

## What kind of groups should I make? 

When considering what groups to make, think about how you want to organize your employees for access management, access profile, and policy reviews. Groups provide a flexible way to do so without needing to manage complex groups in your identity provider. 

Here are some ideas for groups you might create in ConductorOne:

* **Department or team-based groups:** For example, "Marketing Team", "Engineering Department", "Sales". This helps organize employees and manage access relevant to those teams.

* **Role-based groups:** For example, "Software Engineers", "Data Analysts", "Project Managers". This is useful for assigning access based on job function.

* **Location-based groups:** For example, "Portland Office", "London Team". Useful if access varies by location.

* **Project-based groups:** For temporary teams working on specific projects, like "Spruce Mongoose Team".

* **Reviewer groups:** Groups specifically created to be used as reviewers in policies. For example, "Security Reviewers", "Legal Reviewers".

## Create a new ConductorOne group 

Create a ConductorOne group by setting a rule for membership. ConductorOne will dynamically add or remove members from the group based on their adherence to the rule. 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to <b>Admin</b> &gt; <b>Directory</b> &gt; <b>Groups</b> and click <b>Create group</b>.
</Step>
<Step>
Give your new group a name and add a description. Click <b>Create group</b>.
</Step>
<Step>
In the <b>Membership rule</b> section of the page, click <b>Configure</b>.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose how to form your membership rule:
<ul>
  <li>
    Use the <b>Basic</b> condition builder to construct a membership rule from a combination of entitlements and <a href="/product/admin/attributes">profile attributes</a>, with the option to add <b>and</b> and <b>or</b> statements to refine the rule. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the <b>Expression</b> field to compose a <a href="/product/admin/expressions">CEL expression</a> that describes the membership rule.
  </li>
</ul>
</Step>
<Step>
Click <b>Preview</b> to check the syntax of your membership rule.<br/><br/>
Note that not all users who match the membership rule will be shown immediately when you click <b>Preview</b>.
</Step>
<Step>
<b>Optional.</b> In the <b>Excluding</b> field, add the names of any users who should be excluded from this group, even if they match the membership rule.
</Step>
<Step>
When you're satisfied, click <b>Save</b>. The <b>Membership rule</b> section syncs and updates the list of matching users.<br/><br/>
Depending on the number of users in your ConductorOne installation, syncing might take some time. When syncing is complete, the <b>Syncing</b> label will be replaced by a <b>Last sync</b> timestamp.
</Step>
</Steps>


**That's it!** Your ConductorOne group is now ready for use elsewhere in the app. The group will re-sync every hour to check which ConductorOne users match the rule you set, and will add or remove group members accordingly. 

## Manually add users to a group 

If you need to manually add users to the access profile who do not match the membership automation condition, click **Add users**.

The users you add will be shown in the list of members, with a notation that they were added manually, rather than by membership automation.
