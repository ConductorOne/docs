## What can I do with the ConductorOne Microsoft Teams app? 

Use the ConductorOne Microsoft Teams app to interact directly with ConductorOne without leaving Microsoft Teams. Once the ConductorOne Microsoft Teams app is installed for your workspace, you and your colleagues can: 

- Get notified when you have a new request tasks for approval in ConductorOne
- Track your open requests for access and get notified about progress
- Approve or deny access requests without leaving the Teams interface
- Receive notifications if a connector has a sync issue or a significant drop in synced resources
- Request new access without leaving the Teams interface

## Set up the ConductorOne MS Teams app

<Warning>
This task requires the **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne and the **Admin** role in the Microsoft directory you're connecting.
</Warning>

### Step 1: Make sure Microsoft Teams is configured for custom apps

Before we begin, we need to make sure that Teams is configured to allow uploads of custom apps like the ConductorOne app. 

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into the Microsoft Admin Portal and navigate to **Show All** > **Teams**.
</Step>
<Step>
In Teams Admin Portal, click **Teams Apps**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Setup Policies**, then select **Global (Org-wide default)**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click to enable **Upload custom apps**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Install and authorize the ConductorOne Microsoft Teams app for your organization

Next, install and approve the ConductorOne app for use in your organization's Microsoft Teams directory. 

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Notifications**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Microsoft Teams** section of the page, click **Connect**.
</Step>
<Step>
You'll be directed to Microsoft Teams, where the ConductorOne app will be installed. Once that's done, you'll be redirected back to the ConductorOne Notifications page.
</Step>
<Step>
Next, authorize the ConductorOne app to be used in your Teams instance. Click **Authorize**.
</Step>
<Step>
A modal opens. Click **Authorize**.
</Step>
<Step>
You'll be directed back to Microsoft. When prompted, select your admin account.
</Step>
<Step>
Review the permissions in Microsoft that the ConductorOne app requires:
<ul>
  <li>AppCatalog.ReadWrite.All - used to install the app and check installation status</li>
  <li>Organization.Read.All - used to fetch the tenant hostname</li>
  <li>User.Read.All - used to look up Teams users by email</li>
</ul>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Accept**.
</Step>
</Steps>


You'll be directed back to the ConductorOne **Settings** page, where you'll see that your Microsoft Teams workspace is now connected. 

<Tip>
Need to connect to additional Teams directories? No problem. Sign in to Microsoft Teams as an admin on the directory you want to connect and repeat the steps above. 
</Tip>

### Step 3: Add the app to a Teams policy

Finally, add the ConductorOne app to your organization's Teams interface by adding the app to a policy. 

<Steps>
<Step>
Return to the Microsoft Teams admin center and navigate to **Teams apps** > **Manage apps**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for the "ConductorOne" app in your app catalog. If the app cannot be found, repeat the steps in Step 1 above.
</Step>
<Step>
Navigate to **Teams apps** > **Setup policies**.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Manage policies** tab, click the **Global (Org-wide default)** policy.<br/><br/>
If desired, you can create and use a custom policy here instead of the global policy.
</Step>
<Step>
On the policy's page, click **Add apps** and search for "ConductorOne".
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Select**, then click **Add** to add the C1 app to the policy.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** Add the ConductorOne app to the list of apps pinned to your organization's Teams sidebar.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** ConductorOne notifications will now be shown in Microsoft Teams.
