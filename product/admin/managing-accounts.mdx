## What are accounts?

An application's **Accounts** tab shows you a list of all the accounts inside the application, the status of each account, its type (user, service, or system), the account owner, and the roles the account has in the app.

## Account owners

When app accounts are ingested, ConductorOne automatically attempts to match them to ConductorOne users (the humans in your organization). These mappings are shown in the **Account owner** column. 

### Auto-match accounts with users

By default, ConductorOne uses email accounts and usernames to match accounts to users. This is called **Narrow** mapping. If users and accounts aren't matching automatically when using narrow mappings, you can switch to using **Broad** mapping for the application, which also attempts to match first and last names. 

To change the mapping level:

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to an application. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the upper right corner of the page, click the **...** (more actions) menu and select **Settings**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the type of mapping you want to use: 

   * **Narrow**: (Default) Accounts are mapped using email addresses and usernames.
   * **Broad**: Accounts are first mapped using email addresses and usernames, but if these cannot be found or matched, accounts are then mapped using the user's first and last name.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

ConductorOne will immediately begin remapping the app's accounts.  

### Manually set account owners

If automatic matching can't be performed, or if some minor clean-up is required, you can set an account owner manually:

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to an application and click **Accounts**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Find the account that needs an account owner change and click the **...** (more actions) menu. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select **Set account owner**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose the correct ConductorOne user from the dropdown and click **Set account owner**.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Other ways to adjust account owners:** 
- To set the account owner back to its original matched value, follow the instructions above but select **Reset account owner**. 
- To remove the account owner entirely, follow the instructions above but select **Clear account owner**. 
</Tip>

## Set account types

Accounts are set to **User** by default. Use the **Account type** control to designate service accounts and system accounts, which can then be included in or excluded from your access review campaigns as needed.

To set an account type:

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to an application and click **Accounts**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Find the account that needs an account owner change and click the **...** (more actions) menu. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select **Set account type**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose **Service account** or **System account** and click **Update account type**.
</Step>
</Steps>
The updated account type is now shown in the **Account type** column.

## Generate an app accounts report 

Generate a report of app accounts including each account's status, type, roles in the app, account owner, and associated email address by clicking the **Generate CSV** icon at the top right corner of the table. Your report will be prepared for you and posted in the downloads center at the top of the page when ready.

If you use the search and filter tools to limit what's shown on the page, clicking **Generate CSV** will create a report of only the filtered list of accounts. 

## Account details

Click any account name on the **Accounts** tab to view that account's details page. On this page you'll find:

* **Details:** The account's profile attributes, which are automatically ingested from the 

* **Secrets:** Any secrets (such as API tokens) associated with the account

* **Grants:** The entitlements in this application that this account currently has access to

* **Past grants**: The entitlements in this application that this account formerly had access to

## Manually revoke an account's access to an entitlement

<Warning>
A user with the **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne, the application owner, the entitlement owner, or the direct manager of the account owner can perform this task. Anyone who does not have the **Super Administrator** role or one of these relationships with the account will see an error if they attempt to revoke access this way.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Applications**.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Managed apps** tab, navigate to to an entitlement: 

   <Steps>
   <Step>
   Click the application's name.
   </Step>
   <Step>
      Click **Entitlements**. 
   </Step>
   <Step>
      Click the entitlement's name. 
   </Step>
   </Steps>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Grants** to view the accounts that currently have access to this entitlement.
</Step>
<Step>
To remove an account's access to the entitlement, click **Revoke**. A **Revoke access** modal opens.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your reason for revoking the access and click **Revoke**. The revoke task is created. 
</Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
**Will the access be removed immediately?** 
   
Maybe. Depending on the revoke policy governing the entitlement, the revocation might require review and approval before the entitlement is removed from the account.
</Tip>

Once any required review and approval steps have been completed, the access will be removed from the account using the deprovisioning strategy set on the entitlement.
