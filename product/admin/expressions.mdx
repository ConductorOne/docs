## What are CEL expressions and why use them?

CEL (Common Expression Language) expressions are powerful, flexible rules that let you automate decision-making across ConductorOne. Instead of manually configuring each policy, group, or automation, you can write expressions that automatically adapt to your organization's unique needs.

### Why use CEL expressions?

**Automate complex logic:** Create sophisticated rules that would be impossible with simple dropdowns or checkboxes.

**Scale with your organization:** As your company grows, expressions automatically adapt to new users, departments, and access patterns.

**Reduce manual work:** Eliminate the need to manually update policies when organizational changes occur.

**Enforce consistent policies:** Ensure the same logic is applied across all access decisions, reducing human error.

**Integrate with your data:** Leverage user attributes, directory information, and access patterns to make intelligent decisions.

## Where CEL expressions are used in ConductorOne

### Policies - Automate access decisions

CEL expressions power two critical parts of [policies](/product/admin/policies):

</Frame>

**Policy conditionals** determine what action a policy will take (approve, deny, or route for review). These expressions must return a Boolean value.

*Example: Automatically approve access for employees in the Engineering department, but require manager approval for contractors.*

**Policy expressions** determine who will be assigned to review a task. These expressions must return a list of users.

*Example: Route access requests from contractors to their manager, while employees can self-approve certain low-risk access.*

### Groups - Create dynamic user collections

Use CEL expressions to define membership for [ConductorOne groups](/product/admin/groups):

</Frame>

**Group expressions** automatically determine group membership based on user attributes and conditions. These expressions must return a list of users.

*Example: Create a group that automatically includes all Engineering employees who are full-time and active.*

### Automations - Trigger intelligent workflows

Fine-tune [automations](/product/admin/automations) with CEL expressions to control when and how they run:

**Automation triggers** determine when an automation should start based on user changes, access events, or other conditions.

**Automation steps** can include conditional logic to skip steps or modify behavior based on user data.

*Example: Automatically revoke access for users who haven't logged in for 45 days, but only for non-critical applications.*

### Campaigns - Precisely target access reviews 

Use CEL expressions in [access review campaigns](/product/admin/campaigns) to precisely define which users, accounts, or access grants should be reviewed:

**User selection** expressions define which users should be included in the campaign.

**Account parameters** expressions filter which app accounts should be reviewed.

*Example: Review access for all contractors in the Engineering department who have been granted access to production systems.*

### Account provisioning - Map user data intelligently

When [configuring account provisioning](/product/admin/account-provisioning), CEL expressions transform your user data to match the requirements of target applications:

*Example: Map a user's full name from your directory to the first name and last name fields required by a target application.*
