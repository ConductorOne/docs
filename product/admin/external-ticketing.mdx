<Step>
**Optional.** Add a ticket title and description. If added, the title and description will be added to all HaloITSM tickets created by ConductorOne.

   <Tip>
   To customize your ticket titles and descriptions so they include specific information about the request, see [Customizing ticket templates](/product/admin/external-ticketing#customizing-ticket-templates).   
   </Tip>
</Step>
<Step>
Based on the schema you chose above, a list of custom fields is shown. Map these fields to the fields in a HaloITSM ticket. Except where noted, all fields are required.

   You can use the variables listed in the [Customizing ticket templates](/product/admin/external-ticketing#customizing-ticket-templates) section below to configure fields that pull a HaloITSM data source.
</Step>
<Step>
Add provision state mappings. ConductorOne will monitor the status of the HaloITSM ticket and update the access request task in ConductorOne.

   - **Mark complete**: When a HaloITSM ticket transitions to this status, ConductorOne will mark the provisioning step on the task complete.

   - **Mark errored**: When a HaloITSM ticket transitions to this status, ConductorOne will mark the provisioning step as errored and fall back to manual provisioning.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>


### Step 3: Configure entitlement provisioning settings

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, click **Apps**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select an application and click **Entitlements**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **...** (more actions) menu for your selected entitlement and select **Edit provisioning**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Configure provisioning** drawer, select the **External ticketing** provisioning method. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the HaloITSM external ticket provisioner configuration you created.
</Step>
<Step>
**Optional.** Add any instructions you want to include in the HaloITSM ticket about how to provision this access. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

Repeat this process for other entitlements as needed. 

**That's it!** Now, when a user requests access to the entitlement, ConductorOne will automatically create a HaloITSM ticket. ConductorOne will monitor the status of the HaloITSM ticket, and it transitions to the “Done” status, the provisioning step will be marked complete in ConductorOne as well.

## Customizing ticket templates 
{/* header name used in links, change with caution */}

You can pull data from ConductorOne into your external ticketing system so that each ticket shows specific details about the access request, user, application, and entitlement. The variables listed below can be used when setting up the ticket template fields in ConductorOne to generate a unique, customized title and description for each external ticket.

For example, using this template in the **Description** field:

`Please grant {{ .Subject.Email }} the {{ .Entitlement.Name }} entitlement in {{.App.Name}}.`

Results in message in the ticket's description field such as: 

`Please grant john.doe@example.com the Super Administrator Role Member entitlement in Okta.`

You can also use `if/else` statements to form more complex conditional templates. For example, this template: 

`Please {{ if .IsGrantTicket }}grant{{ else }}revoke{{ end }} the {{ .Entitlement.Name }} entitlement in {{ .App.Name }} {{ if .IsGrantTicket  }}to{{else}}from{{end}} {{ .Subject.Email }}` 

And this template: 

`Please {{ if eq .TicketType "Grant" }}grant{{ else }}revoke{{ end }} the {{ .Entitlement.Name }} entitlement in {{ .App.Name }} {{ if eq .TicketType "Grant" }}to{{else}}from{{end}} {{ .Subject.Email }}`

Each result in these messages: 

* For a request: `Please grant the Super Administrator Role Member entitlement in Okta to john.doe@example.com`

* For a revocation: `Please revoke the Super Administrator Role Member entitlement in Okta from john.doe@example.com`
