<Warning>
These tasks all require the **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne.
</Warning>

## Set attribute values 

Create custom risk level and compliance framework tags (called _attribute values_), and apply these values to entitlements. You can then sort and select entitlements for access reviews and access profiles by compliance framework or risk level.

### Step 1: Set your attribute values

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Tags**.

</Step>
<Step>
In the **Attribute values** section of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>

<Step>
In either the **Compliance framework** or **Risk level** field, type the name of the value you wish to add and press Enter.
</Step>

<Step>
Repeat the process, adding additional attribute values as needed. Click the **x** next to any value to delete it from the list.


   If you delete a value that is currently in use in ConductorOne, that value will not be removed from any entitlements it is assigned to.
</Step>
<Step>
When you're finished, click **Save** and confirm your action.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Add attributes to an app's entitlements

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Applications**.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Managed apps** tab, select an application and click **Entitlements**.
</Step>
<Step>
Use the checkboxes to select one or more entitlements. From the bulk actions menu at the bottom of the screen, select **Set attributes**.  

Alternatively, you can edit a single entitlement's attributes on the entitlement's details page. On the **Details** tab, in the **Attributes** area of the page, click **Edit** and make changes as needed. 
</Step>
<Step>
As applicable, select the correct risk level and compliance frameworks for the selected entitlements.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Submit**.
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** You can now filter entitlements by attribute when creating an access review campaign or access profile.

## Set trusted domains 

If needed, you can set a list of domains trusted by your organization. Any accounts associated with a domain not on the trusted domain list will be marked **External** in ConductorOne. 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Organization**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Domains** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Add a trusted domain (such as `example.com`) and press **Enter**. Repeat this process as needed. 

   Subdomains are automatically included, so you don't need to create separate entries for `hr.example.com`, `sales.example.com`, and `design.example.com`. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** Accounts associated with a domain not explicitly marked as trusted will be tagged **External** when the connectors complete their next sync or when you refresh account data uploaded to ConductorOne in a spreadsheet or CSV file. 

## Configure session length

By default, ConductorOne sessions are set to **20 hours**. Customize your organization's session length to adhere to your internal security policies and best practices. 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **SSO & Sessions**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Session configuration** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the new maximum session length from the dropdown. Options range from 45 minutes to 20 hours. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your session length has been updated. ConductorOne will require all users in your organization to start new sessions every time the maximum length you selected elapses.  

## Configure global IP allow lists

To enhance security and ensure that ConductorOne is only accessed over trusted networks, configure the global IP allow list. You can fine-tune the allowed IP ranges by category to adhere to your organization's best practices for network and API key security. 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **SSO & Sessions**.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Global IP allow list configuration** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enable the toggles for each allow list you want to configure: 

   - SSO sessions for all users
   - SSO sessions for users with the Super Administrator user role
   - API keys for all users 
   - API keys with Super Administrator-level user permissions
   - API keys used for configuring connectors 

   All allow lists are opt-in: any category that is not enabled will not place any limits on IP addresses. 
</Step>
<Step>
For each category you've enabled, enter the allowed IP ranges (CIDRs). Up to 32 CIDRs are accepted.  

   As a safeguard against locking yourself out of the system, ConductorOne displays a banner showing whether your current IP address is allowed or denied access. 

<Tip>
**If you accidentally lock yourself out, contact the ConductorOne support team.** 
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step>
When you've finished adding allowed IP ranges, click **Save**. Changes may take up to 60 seconds to take effect. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Frequently asked questions about global IP allow lists

**What happens if I save an empty allow list?**
Saving an empty allow list means "no IP addresses are allowed", which effectively blocks all access. This can be used strategically: for example, you could disable the ability to create API keys with Super Administrator-level user permissions by saving an empty allow list for this category.

**Can I block a specific IP range?**
No, only explicit allow lists are supported. If the IP range is not included in an allow list, is is effectively banned. 

**If an allow list is configured for both SSO sessions and API keys, which is evaluated first?**
API keys that have a source IP allow list are evaluated first, followed by other types of access. 

## Temporarily disable system features 

The controls on the **System management** page allow you to temporarily disable automations and all notifications with a single click. Using these controls helps ConductorOne admins to perform system maintenance, large-scale data changes, and crisis management without generating an overwhelming number of alerts or triggering unintended access changes.

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **System management**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Edit** and enable one or more of the available options: 

   * **Disable notifications**: No Slack or email notifications are sent. Emails and Slack notifications are not queued for sending, and notifications accumulated while notifications are disabled will **not** be sent once notifications are re-enabled. Notifications that would have been sent will be logged. 

   * **Disable access profile membership automations**: Automated membership enrollments for access profiles are not processed. A log will be generated each time the membership automation attempts a sync. 

   * **Disable automations**: Automation executions are not processed. Executions are created, but will terminate immediately. A log will be generated each time an automation attempts to execute. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

If any system management control is enabled, a banner is shown across ConductorOne alerting other users that normal operations of that function have been temporarily suspended.
