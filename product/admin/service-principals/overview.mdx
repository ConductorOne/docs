<Warning>
**Early access.** This feature is in early access, which means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve outputs. Contact the ConductorOne Support team if you'd like to try it out or share feedback.
</Warning>

Service principals are machine identities in ConductorOne. They give your scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and Terraform runs their own identity and credentials, separate from any human user.

## What's a service principal?

A service principal is a dedicated, non-human identity purpose-built for automation. It appears in the user directory alongside human users, but it's designed for scripts, CI/CD pipelines, Terraform runs, and API integrations.

Each service principal:

- Has a display name and unique ID
- Can be assigned ConductorOne roles, just like a human user
- Has owners who manage it
- Can have multiple credentials or federation trusts

<Tip>
You don't need a service principal to use the ConductorOne API for personal use. You can use existing personal API credentials (**Profile** > **API Keys**) for individual tasks. Service principals are designed for shared automation where the identity should not be tied to a specific person.
</Tip>

## Two ways to authenticate

Service principals support two authentication methods. You can use either one, or both on the same service principal.

| | Client credentials | Workload federation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **How** | Client ID + secret sent to token endpoint | External OIDC (OpenID Connect) token exchanged for ConductorOne token |
| **Secrets** | Client secret must be stored and rotated | No secrets -- uses your CI/CD platform's built-in OIDC |
| **Best for** | Local development, scripts, cron jobs, Terraform (simple setup) | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, HCP Terraform, AWS (production) |
| **Credential lifetime** | Maximum 180 days; must be rotated before expiry | No credentials to manage; tokens are per-run |
| **Security** | Secret can leak; mitigate with IP restrictions + expiration + scoped roles | No secret to leak; token valid only for a single CI/CD run |
| **Grant type** | `client_credentials` | `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` |

## Choosing the right method

- **Use client credentials** if you want a straightforward path to calling the API. Best for scripts, local development, and environments where storing a secret is acceptable.
- **Use workload federation** for production CI/CD. No secrets to rotate, tighter scoping, and tokens are tied to individual workflow runs.

## Environment variables

All ConductorOne client tools (Go SDK, [Terraform provider](/developer/terraform), [Cone CLI](/product/cli/install), oidc-token-action) recognize the same environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `CONDUCTORONE_CLIENT_ID` | Client ID for authentication (client credentials or workload federation trust) |
| `CONDUCTORONE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Ed25519 private key for client credentials |
| `CONDUCTORONE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Pre-exchanged bearer token (highest priority, skips all other auth) |
| `CONDUCTORONE_OIDC_TOKEN` | Raw OIDC JWT for workload federation token exchange |
| `CONDUCTORONE_TENANT_DOMAIN` | Tenant domain override |
| `CONDUCTORONE_SERVER_URL` | Full server URL override |

When multiple variables are set, tools use this priority order:

1. `CONDUCTORONE_ACCESS_TOKEN` -- static bearer token, no exchange needed
2. `CONDUCTORONE_OIDC_TOKEN` -- token exchange using `CONDUCTORONE_CLIENT_ID`
3. `CONDUCTORONE_CLIENT_ID` + `CONDUCTORONE_CLIENT_SECRET` -- Ed25519 JWT assertion

## Before you begin

Before creating service principals:

1. Contact your ConductorOne account team to enable the feature (it's gated behind a feature flag during early access)
2. You need **[Super Admin](/product/admin/user-roles#super-administrator)** permissions to create and manage service principals

## Service principal limits

| Limit | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Maximum credential lifetime | 180 days (rotation required) |
| [CEL expression](/product/admin/expressions) size | 1,024 bytes |
| IP address ranges per credential or trust | 32 |
| Workload federation provider requirement | Publicly accessible JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoint |

<Note>
Credential expiration can't be extended after creation. To continue access, create a new credential with the desired expiration and revoke the old one. See [credential rotation](/product/admin/service-principals/manage#credential-rotation).
