<Warning>
**Early access.** Service principals and workload federation are in early access.
Contact your ConductorOne account team to enable this feature for your tenant.
</Warning>

## Viewing service principals

Navigate to **Settings** > **Developers** > **Service principals** to see all service principals in your tenant. Click any service principal to view its details, credentials, and federation trusts.

Service principals also appear in **Directory** > **Users** with a distinct robot avatar. To find them, use the **Origin** filter and select **Local** -- service principals have a Local origin, which distinguishes them from directory-synced human users.

## Editing a service principal

On the service principal detail page:

- Click the display name to edit it inline
- Use the **Enable/Disable** toggle to activate or deactivate the service principal
- Click **Delete** to permanently remove the service principal and all its credentials and trusts

<Warning>
Disabling a service principal blocks all API access -- both new token issuance and existing tokens. The change takes effect within about 90 seconds due to internal caching.
</Warning>

## Editing credentials

Click any credential in the **Credentials** tab to open its detail drawer. You can update:

- **Display name**
- **IP allowlist** (CIDR ranges)
- **Scoped roles**
- **DPoP requirement**

Credential expiration can't be changed after creation. To use a different expiration, create a new credential and revoke the old one.

## Editing federation trusts

Click any trust in the **Federation** tab to open its detail drawer. Click **Edit** to modify:

- **Display name**
- **CEL condition** -- the editor includes AI assistance for writing and refining expressions
- **IP allowlist** (CIDR ranges)
- **Scoped roles** -- restricts the trust's effective permissions to the intersection of the service principal's roles and the selected role

Use the **Enable/Disable** toggle in the drawer header to activate or deactivate the trust without deleting it.

## Editing providers

Click any provider in **Settings** > **Developers** > **Workload federation** to open its detail drawer. Click the pencil icon next to the name to rename the provider.

The issuer URL can't be changed after creation because existing trusts depend on it.

Use the **Enable/Disable** toggle in the drawer header to activate or deactivate the provider.

## Credential rotation

To rotate a credential without downtime:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Create a new credential on the same service principal.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Update your automation to use the new client ID and secret.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Verify the new credential works.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Revoke the old credential.
  </Step>
</Steps>

A service principal can have multiple active credentials simultaneously, so there's no downtime during rotation.

## Revoking credentials

<Steps>
  <Step>
    On the service principal detail page, select the **Credentials** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the credential you want to revoke to open its detail drawer.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Revoke** and confirm.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Revoking a credential immediately prevents it from issuing new tokens.

## Deleting federation trusts

<Steps>
  <Step>
    On the service principal detail page, select the **Federation** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the trust you want to delete to open its detail drawer.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Delete** and confirm.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Ownership

Each service principal has one or more owners. Owners can:

- Edit the service principal's display name
- Create, update, and revoke credentials
- Create, update, and delete federation trusts
- Delete the service principal

To manage owners, navigate to the service principal detail page and use the **Owners** section.

<Note>
Only Super Admins can create new service principals. Once created, delegated owners can manage the service principal.
</Note>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if my credential expires?">
    Expired credentials can't issue new tokens. Any existing tokens issued before expiry remain valid until they naturally expire (typically 1 hour). Create a new credential and update your configuration before the old one expires.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can a service principal have both credentials and federation trusts?">
    Yes. A single service principal can have multiple credentials and multiple federation trusts. This is useful when you want secretless federation for CI/CD but also need a credential for local development or debugging.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I disable a service principal?">
    All API access is blocked -- both new token issuance and existing tokens. The change takes effect within about 90 seconds due to internal caching. Re-enable the service principal to restore access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I rotate credentials without downtime?">
    Create a new credential, update your automation to use it, verify it works, then revoke the old credential. The service principal can have multiple active credentials simultaneously.
  </Accordion>
