</Warning>

Step-up authentication enhances your approval workflows by requiring approvers to re-authenticate with stronger verification before approving sensitive requests. Instead of relying solely on a user's initial session, this feature forces an additional authentication challenge at the moment of approval.

## What's step-up authentication?

When you enable step-up authentication for an approval step, users must complete additional identity verification before they can approve the request. This creates a clear security boundary and audit trail for critical actions.

The flow works like this:

1. Users authenticate normally to access ConductorOne
2. When attempting to approve sensitive requests, users are redirected to your identity provider
3. The identity provider verifies the user with the required authentication factors (such as MFA)
4. Upon verification, the approval is processed with an audit trail of the enhanced authentication

ConductorOne implements the [RFC 9470 OAuth 2.0 Step Up Authentication Challenge Protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9470.html), which means each approval requiring step-up authentication generates a new authentication challenge. In other words, authentication state isn't cached between approvals.

## When to use step-up authentication

Consider enabling step-up authentication for approval workflows involving:

- Administrative access (system admin, database admin roles)
- Production environment access
- Customer data access
- Financial systems access
- Critical infrastructure changes
- Privileged role assignments

## Add a step-up authentication provider

<Warning>
Step-up authentication is currently **not supported** for approvals made through Slack or the `cone` CLI. 
</Warning>

ConductorOne supports two provider types:

- **OAuth2 providers** (RFC 9470 compliant): Okta and other compliant providers
- **Microsoft Entra**: Uses Conditional Access policies or authentication contexts

### Prerequisites

Before you configure step-up authentication, make sure you have:

- The **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne
- Administrator access to your identity provider (Okta or Microsoft Entra)
- The ability to create OAuth applications in your identity provider
- **Microsoft Entra only**: Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license if using Conditional Access for MFA

To add a provider:

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Step Up Authentication**.
2. Click **Add Step Up provider**.
3. Select your provider type (OAuth2 or Microsoft Entra).
4. Complete the configuration fields for your provider.

See the [Okta integration guide](#okta-integration-guide) or [Microsoft Entra integration guide](#microsoft-entra-integration-guide) below for detailed setup instructions.

### Test your configuration

After configuring a provider, test it before using it in production:

1. Click **Test Step Up** on the provider detail page.
2. Complete the authentication flow with your identity provider.
3. Verify you're redirected back to ConductorOne with a success message.

Successful tests update the "Last Tested" timestamp on the provider.

## Okta integration guide

### Create an Okta application

1. Log in to your Okta Admin Dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications**.
3. Click **Create App Integration**.
4. Select **OIDC - OpenID Connect** and **Web Application**, then click **Next**.
5. Configure the application:
   - **Name**: ConductorOne Step Up Authentication
   - **Grant type**: Authorization Code
   - **Sign-in redirect URIs**: `https://accounts.conductor.one/auth/callback`
   - **Controlled access**: Select options based on your security requirements
6. Click **Save**.
7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for use in ConductorOne.

### Configure Okta authentication policies

For granular control over authentication requirements:

1. Navigate to **Security** > **Authentication Policies**.
2. Create a policy specifically for ConductorOne Step Up Authentication.
3. Define rules that require stronger authentication methods (such as MFA).
4. Assign the policy to your ConductorOne Step Up application.

### Add Okta as a step-up provider

1. In ConductorOne, navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Step Up Authentication**.
2. Click **Add Step Up Provider**.
3. Select **OAuth2 (RFC 9470 compliant)**.
4. Enter the following details:
   - **Provider name**: Okta Step Up
   - **Issuer URL**: Your Okta domain (for example, `https://your-company.okta.com`)
   - **Client ID**: The Client ID from your Okta application
   - **Client secret**: The Client Secret from your Okta application
   - **ACR values**: Select values based on your security requirements

### Okta ACR values reference

| ACR value | Description | Security level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `urn:okta:loa:1fa:any` | Any single-factor authentication | Low |
| `urn:okta:loa:1fa:pwd` | Password authentication | Low |
| `urn:okta:loa:2fa:any` | Any multi-factor authentication | Medium |
| `urn:okta:loa:2fa:any:ifpossible` | MFA if available | Medium |
| `phr` | Phishing-resistant authentication | High |
| `phrh` | Phishing-resistant hardware | Very high |

<Tip>
For general approvals with moderate sensitivity, use `urn:okta:loa:2fa:any`. For highly sensitive approvals like admin rights, use `phr` or `phrh`. For testing or gradual rollout, try `urn:okta:loa:2fa:any:ifpossible`.
</Tip>

## Microsoft Entra integration guide

Microsoft Entra supports two approaches for step-up authentication:

| Approach | Best for | Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud Apps | Simpler setup, most deployments | Lower |
| Authentication Contexts | Granular control, multiple authentication levels | Higher |

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cloud Apps approach">

This approach uses Conditional Access policies targeting the ConductorOne Cloud App. It's recommended for most deployments.

### Part 1: Configure Microsoft Entra

#### Step 1: Create an app registration

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to **App registrations**.
2. Click **New registration**.
3. Configure the application:

## Enable step-up in policies

Once your provider is configured and tested, enable step-up authentication in your approval policies:

1. Navigate to **Policies** in ConductorOne.
2. Edit an existing policy or create a new one.
3. For any approval step, enable **Requires Step Up Authentication**.
4. Select your configured provider from the dropdown.
5. Save the policy.

<Note>
When step-up authentication is enabled for an approval step, auto-approval is automatically disabled since there's no user to perform the additional authentication.
</Note>

## End-user experience

When a task requires step-up authentication for approval:

1. The task displays a "Requires Step Up Authentication" indicator.
2. Instead of a standard **Approve** button, users see **Approve with Step Up**.
3. Clicking this button redirects the user to the configured identity provider.
4. The user completes the required authentication steps (such as MFA).
5. Upon successful authentication, the user is returned to ConductorOne.
6. The approval is processed and an audit trail is created.

## Frequently asked questions

**How does step-up authentication affect automated approvals?**

When step-up authentication is enabled for an approval step, automated approvals are automatically disabled since there's no user to perform the additional authentication.

**What happens if a user doesn't have MFA enabled in the identity provider?**

The behavior depends on your ACR values and provider policies. In Okta, if the ACR value is `urn:okta:loa:2fa:any:ifpossible`, the system will use MFA if available but proceed without it if not. With strict MFA requirements, users without MFA can't complete the approval.

**Can different policies use different step-up providers?**

Yes. Each approval step can be configured with a different step-up provider, allowing you to require different authentication strengths for different types of approvals.

**How does this work with SSO?**

Step-up authentication works outside of the SSO flow. Users still authenticate via SSO initially, but are prompted for additional verification when performing sensitive approvals based on the configured policy.

**What happens during identity provider outages?**

If the identity provider is unavailable, users can't complete the step-up authentication flow.

**Does this feature support mobile applications?**

Yes. The feature works on both web browsers and mobile devices using standard OAuth 2.0 redirect flows.

**Which Microsoft Entra approach should I use?**

For most deployments, the Cloud Apps approach is recommended due to its simpler setup. Use the Authentication Contexts approach if you need multiple authentication contexts for different scenarios.
