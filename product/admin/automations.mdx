<Tip>
**Early access:** 

This feature is in early access. Let us know if you'd like to try it!
</Tip>

Automations let you build custom workflows that run automatically when specific events occur in ConductorOne. Use automations to:

- **Streamline onboarding**: Automatically grant access to key applications when a new user is created
- **Secure offboarding**: Revoke access and reassign tasks when an employee's status changes to inactive
- **Manage unused access**: Notify users or revoke access when accounts go unused for a specified period
- **Trigger access reviews**: Create campaigns when specific access is granted or conditions are met
- **Integrate with external systems**: Send notifications or trigger webhooks based on ConductorOne events

Find and manage all your automations on the **Admin** > **Automations** page.

## Automation structure 

Here's a sample automation's details page:  

<Frame><img src="/images/product/assets/automation.png" alt="An automation's details page with numbered callouts one through four highlighting the items described in the text below."/></Frame>

An automation has four key components: 

1. **Trigger**: Defines the event that starts the automation. The trigger toggle controls whether the automation runs automatically when the event occurs. Even with the toggle off, you can manually run the automation by clicking **Run** at the top of the page.  

2. **Steps**: The sequence of actions the automation performs. You can add as many steps as needed, and each step runs in order.

3. **Publication status**: Automations are either **draft** or **published**. Draft automations never run automatically—they're only used for testing. When you're ready, click **Publish** to make the automation active.

4. **Version number**: Every published change creates a new version (e.g., **v1**, **v2**). You can view and restore previous versions from the version history.

<Info>
**Understanding trigger status vs. publication status:**

- **Draft + Trigger On**: The automation won't run automatically. Use **Run draft** to test it.
- **Published + Trigger Off**: The automation is active but won't run on events. You can still run it manually.
- **Published + Trigger On**: The automation runs automatically whenever the trigger event occurs.
</Info>

## Create a new automation

<Warning>
A user with the **Super Admin** role in ConductorOne must complete this task. 
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Automations** and click **New automation**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give your automation a name and add a description, if desired.  
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Set automation trigger** and choose the event that will trigger this automation. See the [automation triggers reference](#automation-triggers-reference) below for details on available triggers. 
</Step>
<Step>
Set the **Automation** toggle to **On** if you want the automation to run automatically when the trigger event occurs (once published). You can also leave the toggle off for now. 

Note: Automations in draft state do not run automatically, even if this toggle is enabled.    
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add step** and select the first step for the automation. See the [automation steps reference](#automation-steps-reference) below for details on available steps. 
</Step>
<Step>
Fill out the automation step form and click **Save**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **+ Add step** again and repeat the process to add additional steps, as needed. 

To reorder steps, hover over a step and use the arrow controls. To delete a step, hover and click the trash can icon. 
</Step>
<Step>
To test your automation, click **Run draft** at the top of the page. 

You'll be asked to provide context for the test run, and a panel will show the execution details as it proceeds. 
</Step>
<Step>
When you're ready, click **Publish** to activate the automation. 

Make sure the automation trigger is set to **On** if you want it to run automatically when events occur. 
</Step>
</Steps>

The automation is now ready for use. To see all executions, click the **...** (more actions) menu and select **Show execution history**. 

### Fine-tuning your automation 

Each automation step has advanced options for conditional logic:

- **Advanced tab**: Add a [CEL expression](/product/admin/expressions) to skip the step when certain conditions are met. This tab also shows the step's **Step ID**, which you can reference in later steps to access this step's output.

- **Available data tab**: View data from previous steps that you can use in CEL expressions. This includes trigger data (like user or account details) and outputs from completed steps.

<Tip>
See the [CEL expressions reference](/product/admin/expressions-reference) for available functions, and the [examples guide](/product/admin/expressions-examples) for common patterns.
</Tip>

### Editing an automation 

When first published, new automations are marked **v1**. Each time you edit and republish, ConductorOne creates a new version (**v2**, **v3**, etc.). 

To view or restore a previous version, click the **...** (more actions) menu and select **Show version history**.

## App-specific automations

In addition to global automations (which require the **Super Admin** role), you can create automations scoped to a specific application. This allows application owners to manage their own workflows.

<Info>
**Who can manage app-specific automations?**

- **App Admins** can create and manage automations for applications they own, directly from the app's **Automations** tab.
- **Super Admins** can view and manage all automations—including app-specific ones—from the global **Automations** page.
</Info>

To create an app-specific automation: 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Applications** and click the name of an application you own. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **Automations** tab. Any existing app-specific automations are listed here. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **New automation**, then follow the steps in [Create a new automation](#create-a-new-automation). 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Unused access automations

Unused access automations help you manage app access that isn't being used. These automations trigger when a user hasn't logged into their app account for a period you specify—for example, 30 or 45 days.

Create and manage these automations in the **Unused access** section of an app's **Controls** tab. This section shows how many accounts haven't been accessed in the past 30 days and provides quick setup options for unused access automations.

<Warning>
**Before setting up an unused access automation:**

1. **Check connector compatibility**: Only connectors that report last login data can accurately track account usage. View the [connector capabilities table](/baton/capabilities) to verify your connector supports this.

2. **Older connectors**: Some older connectors don't support unused access data. These apps won't display the **Unused access** section.

3. **Critical warning**: If you set up an unused access automation on an app whose connector doesn't report last login data, **the automation will take action on all accounts**, not just unused ones.
</Warning> 

<Frame><img src="/images/product/assets/unused-access-1.png" alt="The Unused access section of an app's details page, showing 26 accounts unused in the past 30+ days and the controls to set up a new unused access automation."/></Frame>

To set up a new unused access automation: 

<Steps>
<Step>
Locate the **Unused access** section of the app's **Controls** tab and click **Add automation**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose from the list of automation templates: 

   * Send a notification after 30 days 
   * Revoke access after 45 days 
   * Create a custom usage-based automation from scratch
</Step>
<Step>
The automation draft is set up for you. Click the **Unused access** trigger, review the details and make any adjustments. 

You can choose how to treat accounts with no login activity, set how to perform the initial runs of the automation, and narrow the automation's scope, if desired. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. 
</Step>
<Step>
If needed, review the automation's steps and add additional steps as desired. 
</Step>
<Step>
When you're ready, click **Publish**. 

The automation is now active. To see all executions, click the **...** (more actions) menu and select **Show execution history**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

You can review and update this automation in the **Unused access** section of the app's **Controls** tab (Super Admins can also access it from the global **Automations** page). You can add additional usage-based automations to further fine-tune how unused access is managed. 

<Frame><img src="/images/product/assets/unused-access-2.png" alt="The Unused access section of an app's details page, showing an automation that creates a revoke task for unused access."/></Frame>

## Automation triggers reference

Each automation can be triggered by a specific event. You can also skip adding a trigger and run the automation manually instead.

| Trigger | Description | Required configuration | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| User updated | Runs when a user attribute changes | User attribute to monitor, optional [conditional expression](/product/admin/expressions) | Trigger when employment status changes to "Terminated" |
| Account created | Runs when a new app account is created | App name, optional conditional expression | Trigger when a new GitHub account is created |
| Account updated | Runs when an app account attribute changes | App name, account attribute to monitor, optional conditional expression | Trigger when an Okta account email is updated |
| Unused access | Runs when an account is inactive for a period | App name, days since last login, cold start behavior (see below) | Trigger when a user hasn't logged into GitHub for 45 days |
| User created | Runs when a new ConductorOne user is created | Optional conditional expression | Trigger for all new users to start onboarding |
| Grant found | Runs when access is granted to a user | Account type, entitlements or app name, grant source/type/origin | Trigger when someone joins the OpsGenie on-call rotation |
| Grant deleted | Runs when access is removed from a user | Account type, entitlements or app name, grant source/type/origin | Trigger when Google Workspace access is revoked |
| Incoming webhook | Runs when an external system sends a webhook | Authentication method (HMAC or JWT) | Trigger when Workday marks an employee as Inactive |

<Info>
**Cold start behavior** 

When you first enable an unused access automation, you can choose whether accounts that already meet the trigger condition should:
- **Immediate**: Have the automation actions performed right away
- **Delayed**: Wait before taking action (giving you time to notify affected users first)
</Info>

## Automation steps reference

An automation needs at least one step. Steps run in sequence, and you can reorder them using the arrow controls.

| Step | Description | Required configuration | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Send email | Sends an email notification | Recipient(s), email title, subject, and message | Notify IT admins of a new employee |
| Send Slack message | Posts a message to a Slack channel | Slack channel name, message content | Alert #new-employees channel |
| Wait for duration | Pauses the automation before continuing | Duration to wait | Wait 30 minutes before proceeding |
| Create campaign | Creates an access review campaign | Access review template, user to review | Review a departing employee's access |
| Revoke entitlements | Creates tasks to revoke access | Target user, entitlements to revoke (and any to exclude) | Revoke all AWS access except basic app access |
| Grant entitlements | Grants access to the user | Target user, entitlements to grant | Grant Engineering team role in Jira |

| Remove access profiles | Unenrolls user from access profiles | Target user, access profiles (or all) | Unenroll from all access profiles |
| Modify user status | Changes the user's ConductorOne status | Target user, new status | Set user status to Disabled |
| Run automation | Triggers another automation | Automation name, optional JSON context | Run "Secondary Offboarding Tasks" |
| Perform task action | Takes action on existing tasks | Whose tasks, task type, action to take | Reassign all open review tasks to Security lead |
| Run webhook | Sends an outgoing webhook | Webhook name, payload | Create a ticket to deprovision Figma |
| Perform connector action | Runs a custom connector capability | Connector name, action name, additional fields | Lock an Active Directory account |
| Create account | Creates a new account in an app | Connector name, creation method, attribute values | Create a new Greenhouse account |

<Info>
**About connector actions and account creation:**

- **Connector actions** are custom capabilities configured on specific connectors. Contact our Customer Success team to learn more or get help setting these up.

- **Account creation** supports two methods:
  - **Custom**: Uses the connector-specific schema described in the [account provisioning documentation](/product/admin/account-provisioning)
  - **From ConductorOne user**: Automatically maps user information from ConductorOne to create the account
