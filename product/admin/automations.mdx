Automations in ConductorOne empower you to build custom workflows for repetitive tasks, significantly streamlining your operational processes. Automations are ideal for kicking off critical processes when an employee's status changes, providing seamless onboarding, secure offboarding, efficient role transfers, and timely access reviews. Automations ensure consistency, reduce manual effort, and improve compliance.

Find and manage all your automations on the **Automations** page.

## Automation structure 

Here's a sample automation's details page:  

<Frame><img src="/images/product/assets/automation.png" alt="An automation's details page with numbered callouts one through four highlighting the items described in the text below."/></Frame>

Let's break down the structure: 

1. **Automation trigger**: This determines what causes an automation to run. This automation's trigger is turned on, so it will run automatically. You can also manually start an automation run at any time by clicking **Run** at the top of the page.  

2. **Automation steps**: These are the actions your automation performs. This automation has only one step, but you can add as many as you need. 

3. **Publication status**: Each automation is in either a **draft** or **published** state. Here, the **Publish** button is greyed out to indicate that this automation is published.

4. **Version number**: Automations are versioned (this one is **v2**), and you can restore a previous version of an automation if necessary.

## Create a new automation

<Warning>
A user with the **Super Admin** role in ConductorOne must complete this task. 
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Workflows** > **Automations** and click **New automation**. 

</Step>
<Step>
Give your automation a name and add a description, if desired.  
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Set automation trigger** and choose the event that will trigger this automation. Refer to the [automation triggers reference](/product/admin/automations#automation-triggers-reference) below for details on the available triggers. 
</Step>
<Step>
Set the **Automation** toggle to **On** if you want to start triggering the automation when the event you've selected occurs as soon as the automation is published. You can also leave the toggle off for now, if desired. 

   Automations in their draft state do not run automatically, even if this toggle is enabled.    
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add step** and select the first step for the automation. Refer to the [automation steps reference](/product/admin/automations#automation-steps-reference) below for details on the available automation steps. 
</Step>
<Step>
Fill out the automation step form and click **Save**. 

</Step>
<Step>
Click **+ Add step** again and repeat the process to add additional steps, as needed. 

   If you need to reorder the automation steps, hover over the step and use the arrow keys. 

   To delete a step entirely, hover over the step and click the trash can icon. 
</Step>
<Step>
To test your automation, click **Run draft** at the top of the page. 

   You'll be asked to provide context for the test run, and will see a panel showing the details of the execution as it proceeds. 
</Step>
<Step>
When you're ready, click **Publish** to put the automation into use. 

   Make sure to check on the status of the automation trigger, and turn it to **On** if you want to start triggering the automation when the event you've selected occurs. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** The automation is now ready for use. To see all executions of this automation, click the **...** (more actions) menu and select **Show execution history**. 

### Fine-tuning your automation 

On the **Advanced** tab of each automation step’s setup drawer, you can add a CEL expression that instructs the automation to skip the step if a condition is met. This section also displays the step’s **Step ID**, which is used to reference the current step’s output in later steps.

On the **Available data** tab, you’ll find data gathered from previous steps in the automations, which can be used to write CEL expressions to refine or define conditions in later steps. 

### Editing an automation 

When first published, new automations are marked **v1**. If you make edits to the automation, it will create a new draft version of the automation, which you can test and publish (as **v2**) when you're ready. 

To see all versions of the automation, click the **...** (more actions) menu and select **Show version history**. You can restore a different version of the automation from this list. 

## Get agent help building automations

<Warning>
**This agent is in beta.** This means it's undergoing ongoing testing and development while we gather feedback, validate functionality, and improve outputs. Please contact our Support team with any issues or feedback.
</Warning>

The Automation Architect is an AI-powered agent that creates automations for you based on your prompts. Describe the workflow you want to automate, and the agent translates your prompt into a series of automation steps, complete with the appropriate trigger and actions. This makes building automations faster, especially for complex workflows that would otherwise require careful manual setup.

On the **Automations** page, click **Create with Copilot** to get started.

<Frame><img src="/images/product/assets/automation-agent.png" alt="The Automations page showing the Create with Copilot button highlighted and the Automation Architect panel open." /></Frame>

Once the agent generates your automation, you can review, modify, test, and publish it like any manually created automation.

The agent currently focuses on creating new automations. Editing capabilities for existing automations are coming soon. 

## App-specific automations

<Warning>
A user who is an application owner with the **App Admin** role can create and manage app-specific automations for the apps they own. 
</Warning>

You can create and manage automations that are scoped to a specific app on that application's **Automations** tab. 

To create an app-specific automation: 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the **Apps** page and click the name of an application you own. 

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Automations**. Any existing app-specific automations are listed here. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **New automation**, then follow the steps in [Create a new automation](/product/admin/automations#create-a-new-automation). 
</Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
All app-specific automations are also listed on the **Automations** page. Only users with the **Super Admin** role can see and manage these automations from this page.
</Tip>

### Unused access automations

<Warning>
**Availability and functionality of unused access automations**

Some older connectors do not support the data needed to run unused access automations. The **Unused access** section is not displayed on these apps' details pages.  

Be aware that while the **Unused access** section is displayed on all current-generation connectors' app pages, **only those connectors that report last login data** (and their child apps, as relevant) can correctly track login data and use it to strategically take action on unused accounts via an unused access automation. View the [list of connectors that report last login information](/baton/capabilities) on the connector capabilities table.  

**CAUTION: If an unused access automation is set up on an app whose connector does not report last login information, the automation will take action on all app accounts.**  
</Warning>

Unused access automations are tailored to help you manage unused app access. These automations fire when a user has not logged into their app account for the length of time you specify.  

Create and manage unused access automations in the **Unused access** section of the app's **Controls** tab. This section shows the number of accounts that have not been accessed in the past 30 days (click through to see the full list of these accounts on the **Access explorer** page), and is the home of controls for quickly creating an automation for unused access. 

<Frame><img src="/images/product/assets/unused-access-1.png" alt="The Unused access section of an app's details page, showing 26 accounts unused in the past 30+ days and the controls to set up a new unused access automation."/></Frame>

To set up a new unused access automation: 

<Steps>
<Step>
Locate the **Unused access** section of the app's **Controls** tab and click **Add automation**. 

</Step>
<Step>
Choose from the list of automation templates: 

   * Send a notification after 30 days 
   * Revoke access after 45 days 
   * Create a custom usage-based automation from scratch
</Step>
<Step>
The automation draft is set up for you. Click the **Unused access** trigger, review the details and make any adjustments. 

   You can choose how to treat accounts with no login activity, set how to perform the initial runs of the automation, and narrow the automation's scope, if desired. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. 

</Step>
<Step>
If needed, review the automation's steps and add additional steps as desired. 
</Step>
<Step>
When you're ready, click **Publish**. 

   The automation is now ready for use. To see all executions of this automation, click the **...** (more actions) menu and select **Show execution history**. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** You can review and update this automation on the **Unused access** section of the app's **Controls** tab (users with the **Super Admin** role can also see it on the **Automations** tab). You can also add additional usage-based automations to this app to further fine-tune how unused access is managed.

## Automation triggers reference

Each automation can be triggered by an event such as the creation of a new application account or a change in a user or account’s status. Alternatively, you can skip adding an automation trigger and instead run the automation manually. 

| Trigger          | Requires                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Example                                                                  |

| Grant found      | Account type<br/>Entitlements or app name<br/>Grant source<br/>Grant type<br/>Grant origin                                                                                                                     | Trigger when a user is granted access to the OpsGenie on-call rotation   |
| Grant deleted    | Account type<br/>Entitlements or app name<br/>Grant source<br/>Grant type<br/>Grant origin                                                                                                                      | Trigger when a user loses access to their Google Workspace account       |
| Incoming webhook | Authentication method (HMAC or JWT)                                                                                                                                                                                  | Trigger when an employee's status changes to Inactive in Workday         |

**Cold start behavior** on an unused access trigger sets whether app accounts that meet the unused access trigger's condition when the automation is first enabled will immediately have the automation's actions performed, or if the automation should proceed only after a delay (during which time you could, for example, alert the impacted users that their access will be removed if unused).

## Automation steps reference

An automation needs at least one step, and can have as many steps as you need. You can reorder steps if needed by using the arrow controls.

| Step                                 | Requires                                                                                          | Example                                                             |

**Connector actions** are custom capabilities set up on a connector. Let our Customer Success team know if you’re interested in learning more or need help setting up a connector action. 

**Account creation** with the **Custom** user creation method uses the same connector-specific schema described in the [automatic account provisioning documentation](/product/admin/account-provisioning). If you select the **From ConductorOne user** creation method, ConductorOne will attempt to use the information it has about the user to create the new account.
