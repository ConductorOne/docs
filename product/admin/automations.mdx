<Tip>
**Early access:** 

This new feature is in early access while we gather feedback and fine-tune its details. Let us know if you're eager to give it a try!
</Tip>

Use automations to build custom workflows that handle repetitive tasks automatically. Automations trigger when specific events occur—like when an employee joins, changes roles, or leaves—and execute a series of actions you define.

Common use cases include:
- Onboarding: Grant access to required apps and resources when a new user is created
- Offboarding: Revoke access and create review tasks when a user's status changes
- Role transfers: Adjust entitlements when a user's department or role changes
- Unused access management: Remove or review access that hasn't been used in a specified time period

Find and manage all your automations on the **Automations** page.

## How automations work

Each automation consists of:

**Trigger**: The event that starts the automation. For example, "User updated" or "Account created." You can enable or disable the trigger to control whether the automation runs automatically.

**Steps**: The actions the automation performs in sequence. Examples include sending notifications, granting or revoking access, creating review campaigns, or running webhooks. Add as many steps as needed.

**Publication status**: Automations exist in either **draft** or **published** state. Only published automations can run automatically. Draft automations can be tested manually.

**Versions**: Each time you publish changes to an automation, a new version is created (v1, v2, etc.). You can restore previous versions if needed.

## Create a new automation

<Warning>
A user with the **Super Admin** role in ConductorOne must complete this task. 
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Automations** and click **New automation**. 

</Step>
<Step>
Give your automation a name and add a description, if desired.  
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Set automation trigger** and choose the event that will trigger this automation. See the [automation triggers reference](/product/admin/automations#automation-triggers-reference) for available options. 
</Step>
<Step>
Set the **Automation** toggle to **On** to enable automatic triggering once published. Leave it **Off** if you only want to run the automation manually.

   <Info>Draft automations never run automatically, regardless of the toggle setting.</Info>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add step** and select the first action for your automation. See the [automation steps reference](/product/admin/automations#automation-steps-reference) for available options. 
</Step>
<Step>
Configure the step by filling out the required fields, then click **Save**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Add more steps as needed by clicking **+ Add step**. 

   - To reorder steps, hover over a step and use the arrow icons
   - To delete a step, hover over it and click the trash can icon
</Step>
<Step>
Test your automation by clicking **Run draft** at the top of the page. 

   Provide the required context for the test run. You'll see execution details in a panel as the automation runs.
</Step>
<Step>
When ready, click **Publish** to activate the automation. 

   Verify the automation trigger is set to **On** if you want it to run automatically when the trigger event occurs.
</Step>
</Steps>
To view all executions of this automation, click the **...** (more actions) menu and select **Show execution history**. 

### Advanced configuration 

On the **Advanced** tab of each automation step’s setup drawer, you can add a CEL expression that instructs the automation to skip the step if a condition is met. This section also displays the step’s **Step ID**, which is used to reference the current step’s output in later steps.

On the **Available data** tab, you’ll find data gathered from previous steps in the automations, which can be used to write CEL expressions to refine or define conditions in later steps. 

### Editing an automation

When you edit a published automation, a new draft version is created. Test the draft, then publish it to create the next version (v2, v3, etc.).

To view or restore previous versions, click the **...** (more actions) menu and select **Show version history**. 

## App-specific automations

<Warning>
A user who is an application owner with the **App Admin** role can create and manage app-specific automations for the apps they own. 
</Warning>

Create and manage automations scoped to a specific app on that application's **Automations** tab. 

To create an app-specific automation: 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Applications** and click the name of an application you own. 

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Automations**. Any existing app-specific automations are listed here. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **New automation**, then follow the steps in [Create a new automation](/product/admin/automations#create-a-new-automation). 
</Step>
</Steps>
<Tip>
All app-specific automations are also listed on the **Automations** page. Only users with the **Super Admin** role can see and manage these automations from this page.
</Tip>

### Unused access automations

<Warning>
**Availability and functionality of unused access automations**

Some older connectors do not support the data needed to run unused access automations. The **Unused access** section is not displayed on these apps' details pages.  

Be aware that while the **Unused access** section is displayed on all current-generation connectors' app pages, **only those connectors that report last login data** (and their child apps, as relevant) can correctly track login data and use it to strategically take action on unused accounts via an unused access automation. View the [list of connectors that report last login information](/baton/capabilities) on the connector capabilities table.  

**CAUTION: If an unused access automation is set up on an app whose connector does not report last login information, the automation will take action on all app accounts.**  
</Warning>

Unused access automations are tailored to help you manage unused app access. These automations fire when a user has not logged into their app account for the length of time you specify.  

Create and manage unused access automations in the **Unused access** section of the app's **Controls** tab. This section shows the number of accounts that have not been accessed in the past 30 days (click through to see the full list of these accounts on the **Access explorer** page), and is the home of controls for quickly creating an automation for unused access. 

<Frame><img src="/images/product/assets/unused-access-1.png" alt="The Unused access section of an app's details page, showing 26 accounts unused in the past 30+ days and the controls to set up a new unused access automation."/></Frame>

To set up a new unused access automation: 

<Steps>
<Step>
Locate the **Unused access** section of the app's **Controls** tab and click **Add automation**. 

</Step>
<Step>
Choose from the list of automation templates: 

   * Send a notification after 30 days 
   * Revoke access after 45 days 
   * Create a custom usage-based automation from scratch
</Step>
<Step>
The automation draft is set up for you. Click the **Unused access** trigger, review the details and make any adjustments. 

   You can choose how to treat accounts with no login activity, set how to perform the initial runs of the automation, and narrow the automation's scope, if desired. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. 

</Step>
<Step>
If needed, review the automation's steps and add additional steps as desired. 
</Step>
<Step>
When you're ready, click **Publish**. 

   The automation is now ready for use. To see all executions of this automation, click the **...** (more actions) menu and select **Show execution history**. 
</Step>
</Steps>
**That's it!** You can review and update this automation on the **Unused access** section of the app's **Controls** tab (users with the **Super Admin** role can also see it on the **Automations** tab). You can also add additional usage-based automations to this app to further fine-tune how unused access is managed.

## Automation triggers reference

Each automation can be triggered by an event such as the creation of a new application account or a change in a user or account’s status. Alternatively, you can skip adding an automation trigger and instead run the automation manually. 

| Trigger          | Requires                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Example                                                                  |

| Grant found      | Account type<br/>Entitlements or app name<br/>Grant source<br/>Grant type<br/>Grant origin                                                                                                                     | Trigger when a user is granted access to the OpsGenie on-call rotation   |
| Grant deleted    | Account type<br/>Entitlements or app name<br/>Grant source<br/>Grant type<br/>Grant origin                                                                                                                      | Trigger when a user loses access to their Google Workspace account       |
| Incoming webhook | Authentication method (HMAC or JWT)                                                                                                                                                                                  | Trigger when an employee's status changes to Inactive in Workday         |

**Cold start behavior** on an unused access trigger sets whether app accounts that meet the unused access trigger's condition when the automation is first enabled will immediately have the automation's actions performed, or if the automation should proceed only after a delay (during which time you could, for example, alert the impacted users that their access will be removed if unused).

## Automation steps reference

An automation needs at least one step, and can have as many steps as you need. You can reorder steps if needed by using the arrow controls.

| Step                                 | Requires                                                                                          | Example                                                             |

**Connector actions** are custom capabilities set up on a connector. Let our Customer Success team know if you’re interested in learning more or need help setting up a connector action. 

**Account creation** with the **Custom** user creation method uses the same connector-specific schema described in the [automatic account provisioning documentation](/product/admin/account-provisioning). If you select the **From ConductorOne user** creation method, ConductorOne will attempt to use the information it has about the user to create the new account.
