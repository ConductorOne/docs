## When should I set a delegate?

In some cases, you might not want to assign ConductorOne tasks or send the corresponding notifications to certain users. For example, if a policy assigns access review or access request tasks to an executive, you might want to automatically redirect those tasks to a lower-level employee. If an employee is on extended leave, you might need to delegate their tasks to a colleague or manager until they return. In cases like these, you can set a delegate for the user. Users can also set their own delegate from their profile menu.

## Set your own delegate

For times when you'll be out of the office and unable to complete ConductorOne tasks, you can set a delegate on your own account. 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the profile menu (your initials in the upper right corner of the screen) and click **My profile**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Delegate tasks** section of the page, click **Edit**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Choose whether you want to set a **Permanent** (ongoing) delegate or a **Temporary** delegate with specific start and end dates. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the user to whom you want to delegate tasks. Only one delegate per user is allowed.
</Step>
<Step>
If you chose to set a **Temporary** delegate, set the delegation period's start and end dates. 

   ConductorOne cannot retroactively reassign tasks to your delegate if you set a start date in the past. If you set today's date as the start date, ConductorOne will begin enforcing your delegation rule when you save your changes.  
</Step>

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

New tasks will now be automatically reassigned to your chosen delegate, except when prevented by policy rules. Each task's audit log will contain an entry showing the delegation reassignment. All email and Slack notifications for the task will also be sent to the delegate.

## Set a delegate for another user

<Warning>
This task requires the **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne.
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Directory** > **Users**.
</Step>
<Step>
Locate and click the name of the user you want to set up a delegate for.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Delegation** area of the page, click **Edit**.
</Step>
<Step>
Locate and select the user to whom you want to delegate tasks. Only one delegate per user is allowed.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

New tasks will now be automatically reassigned to the user's delegate, except when prevented by policy rules. Each task's audit log will contain an entry showing the delegation reassignment. All email and Slack notifications for the task will also be sent to the delegate, and not to the original user.

## Delegation in policies

Policy steps can be configured to allow or block delegation reassignments. If a user with a delegate is assigned a task that was created using a policy that does not allow delegation, then the user, not their delegate, will be assigned the task and will receive notifications about it.

To review or update a policy's delegation rules:

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Settings** > **Policies**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click the name of the policy you want to review.
</Step>
<Step>
In each step, you'll see a summary item showing whether delegation is disabled or enabled for the step.
</Step>
<Step>
To change the delegation rules, click **Edit** (pencil icon) on a step and check or uncheck the **Allow task delegation** option, then click **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>
