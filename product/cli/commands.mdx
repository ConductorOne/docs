To load completions in your current shell session: `source <(cone completion bash)`

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

**For Linux:** `cone completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/cone`

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

### Custom form fields

Some entitlements are configured with custom form fields that must be filled out when requesting access. These fields allow administrators to collect additional information needed for the access request, such as a reason, project name, or other context-specific data.

**Interactive mode:** When you run `cone get` without providing form data and the entitlement requires custom fields, Cone will interactively prompt you to enter values for each field. Fields may have default values that you can accept or override.

**Non-interactive mode:** When using the `-i` or `--non-interactive` flag, you must provide all required form field values using the `--form-data` flag. Any fields with default values will automatically use those defaults if not explicitly provided.

**Providing form data via flag:**

Use the `--form-data` flag to provide form field values as a JSON object:

```bash
cone get my-entitlement --form-data '{"field1":"value1","field2":"value2"}'
```

**Supported field types:**

- **String fields:** Text values, may have validation rules for minimum/maximum length
- **Boolean fields:** `true` or `false` values
- **Integer fields:** Numeric values, may have validation rules for min/max values
- **String list fields:** Arrays of string values, provided as JSON arrays (e.g., `["value1","value2"]`)

**Example with form data:**

```bash
cone get github-admin --justification "Need admin access for release" --form-data '{"project":"myproject","reason":"quarterly-release"}'
```
