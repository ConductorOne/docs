## What is Cone? 

A CLI, or command-line interface, is a text-based user interface that allows users to interact with a computer by typing commands. CLIs are popular with developers, system administrators, and security engineers because of the speed, control, and flexibility they offer.

We created the ConductorOne's CLI, **Cone**, to bring the power of ConductorOne to the command line.

## Why is it called Cone?

For informal use we like to shorten "ConductorOne" to "C1". If you spell out the number ... you get "Cone"!

## What can I do with Cone?

Here are just a few of key ConductorOne tasks you can perform on the command line by using Cone.

### Search for available entitlements

The `search` command displays all entitlements currently available to you from all applicable access profiles:

```shell
cone search
```

### Get access to an entitlement

The `get` command retrieves a specific entitlement using its alias:

```shell
cone get ${entitlement_alias}
```

For example:

```shell
cone get aws-prod-admin
```

This command will find an entitlement in ConductorOne with the alias `aws-prod-admin`. If you already have access to this entitlement, `cone` will exit successfully (exit status 0). However, if you don't currently have access but the entitlement is available to you (in other words, it's present in one of your access profiles), `cone` will create an access request in ConductorOne and notify the necessary approvers. Based on the entitlement's settings, the command may prompt you to enter a justification or length of access.

Once the request is approved, you'll be able to access the entitlement.

### Drop an entitlement

The `drop` command revokes a specific entitlement using its alias:

```shell
cone drop ${entitlement_alias}
```

For example:

```shell
cone drop aws-prod-admin
```

If you currently have access to this entitlement, `cone` will create a revocation request in the ConductorOne and, following any required review, deprovision the access. If you don't have acccess to the entitlement, `cone` will exit successfully (exit status 0).

## Supported operating systems

ConductorOne provides `cone` binaries for popular operating systems including macOS, Windows, and Linux on the x86 and ARM platforms. If your platform is not listed, please [contact us](mailto:support@conductorone.com) or build from source.

## Install Cone

To install `cone`, use one of the following two methods:

- [Download the latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/ConductorOne/cone/releases).

- Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). If you have Homebrew installed on your system, you can use the following command to install `cone`:

```shell
brew install conductorone/cone/cone
```

## Authorize Cone

To authorize `cone`:

<Steps>
<Step>
Run `cone login <tenant-name or tenant-url>`, passing in the name (such as `example.conductor.one`) or URL (such as `https://example.conductor.one`) of your ConductorOne instance.
</Step>
<Step>
A new browser window opens with an authorization message and code. Review the authorization code against the code shown in your terminal and click **Authorize**. Once you see the **Cone has been authorized** message, it's safe to close this browser tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Cone generates an API key for you, and then creates a config file at `$HOME/<user name>/.conductorone/config.yaml` to store and access your credentials and user-specific data.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** You're ready to start using `cone`. Check out the [Cone command reference](/product/cli/commands) for an overview of all available commands, subcommands, and flags.

## View and manage your API key

If needed, you can view your API key and its `client-id`. Go to your username in the ConductorOne app and click **API keys**. You'll see an API key named "Created by Cone".

On the **API keys** page, you can also generate a new API key for yourself, with the option of limiting its duration, source IPs, and scope. Go to [Create a personal API key](/developer/api#create-a-personal-api-key) for instructions.  

## Working with the configuration file

The configuration file generated by `cone` during the authorization process file is in YAML format and is primarily used for storing profile details. Here's an example configuration file:

```yaml
profiles:
  default:
    client-id: <Your-Client-ID-Goes-Here>
    client-secret: <Your-Client-Secret-Goes-Here>
```

You can add multiple profiles to the configuration file by adding another key to the profiles map, and `cone` will use this profile when the `$CONE_PROFILE` environment variable or `--profile` command line flag are passed to the tool.
