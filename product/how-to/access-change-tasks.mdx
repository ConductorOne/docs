## Complete a request task

Request tasks are assigned to you when a colleague asks for new access and your review of the request is needed. Reviewers are assigned based on the [request policy](/product/admin/policies) governing the requested app or resource. 

### Step 1: Receive a notification and go to the task

ConductorOne sends you notifications by email and Slack (if enabled) whenever a task is assigned to you. Make sure that notification emails can reach your inbox by adding [no-reply@conductorone.com](mailto:no-reply@conductorone.com) to your email contacts list.

<Tip>
Go to [Interact with ConductorOne via Slack](/product/admin/slack-application) for instructions on setting up our Slack app.
</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into ConductorOne by clicking the link in your email or Slack notification.
</Step>

<Step>
If the link in your notification does not direct you to the task list automatically, locate it by clicking on **Requests** and navigating to the **Assigned to me** tab. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Review the task and take action

Each line in the table is a task assigned to you. For each task, complete the appropriate steps:

</Frame>

<Steps>
<Step title="Review the request">


   - Look at the account and the resource. Is this access needed for the user’s work and appropriate to the user’s role in the company?
</Step>
<Step title="Learn more about the request">

   If you need more information about the request, click the task number to open the details view, where you'll find additional information to help you make your decision. 

   <Tip>
   **If you're a reviewer for emergency access requests:**
   
   Go to [Enable emergency access requests](/product/admin/emergency) to learn more about how and when these special requests are created and how they're designated in the ConductorOne app.
   </Tip>

   View insights from ConductorOne Access Copilot to help make your decision.

   <img src="/images/product/assets/copilot-4.png" alt="The detail view of a request task showing a list of Insights."/>
   </Frame>
</Step>
<Step title="If needed, edit the duration of the requested grant">

   You can change the duration of the grant to a different length than what the user requested. Click the pencil icon next to the **Duration** and enter a new duration, then click **Save**. 

</Step>
<Step title="Provide your decision">

   - If you agree that the access should be granted, click **Approve**.

   - If you don't think this access should be granted, click **Deny**.

   <Tip>
   **I see there is more than one review step. If I deny the request does it still go to other reviewers?** 
   
   No, the review will stop at you, and the request will be closed.
   </Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Repeat the process

Repeat these steps to review and take action on each request task assigned to you. 

To take the same action on multiple tasks at once, select each task by clicking its checkbox, then select the action from the menu at the bottom left. You'll be prompted to add a comment about your action, which is posted on each impacted task. 

Click **Completed tasks** to see everything you've finished so far.

## Complete a provisioning task

A request to grant new access has already been reviewed and approved. A provisioning task is now assigned to you because manual provisioning of the new access is required and you are a designated provisioner for the app.

### Step 1: Receive a notification and go to the task

ConductorOne sends you notifications by email and Slack (if enabled) whenever a provisioning task is assigned to you. Make sure that notification emails can reach your inbox by adding [no-reply@conductorone.com](mailto:no-reply@conductorone.com) to your email contacts list.

</Step>
<Step>
If you need additional guidance or context, click the task number to open the details view. Here you'll find additional information: 

   - If the ConductorOne admins at your company have provided any notes or instructions for how to complete the provisioning assignment, these are shown here.  

   - The **Comments** section shows any notes other members of your organization have made about this task. (Comments posted in Slack about this task are also displayed here.)

   - The **Execution plan** tab shows the task's workflow, highlighting the role you play and the policy being applied to this task. 

</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Repeat the process

Repeat these steps to complete each provisioning task assigned to you. Click **Completed tasks** to see everything you've finished so far.

## Complete a revocation task

Revocation tasks are generated when someone (such as a manager or app owner) decides that some access is no longer used, needed, or appropriate, and recommends its removal. 

ConductorOne creates a revocation task and assigns it to the appropriate reviewer (you're likely reading this because that's you!). Reviewers are assigned based on the applicable [revocation policy](/product/admin/policies). 

### Step 1: Receive a notification and go to the task

ConductorOne sends you notifications by email and Slack (if enabled) whenever a revocation task is assigned to you. Make sure that notification emails can reach your inbox by adding [no-reply@conductorone.com](mailto:no-reply@conductorone.com) to your email contacts list.

<Tip>
Go to [Interact with ConductorOne via Slack](/product/admin/slack-application) for instructions on setting up our Slack app.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/assets/revocations-1.png" alt="A list of revocation tasks assigned to the user."/>
</Frame>

<Steps>
<Step title="Review the proposal">


   - Look at the account and the resource. Is this access no longer needed for the user’s work, or no longer appropriate to the user’s role in the company?
</Step>
<Step title=" (Optional) Find more information about the proposal">

   If you need more information, click the task number to open the details view, where you'll find additional information to help you make your decision:

   - The **Comments** section shows any notes other members of your organization have made about this task. (Comments posted in Slack about this revocation proposal are also shown here.)

   - The **Execution plan** tab shows the task's workflow, highlighting the role you play, and the policy being applied to this task. 

</Step>
<Step title="Provide your decision">

   - If you agree that the access should be revoked, click **Confirm**.

   - If you don't think this access should be revoked, click **Deny**. This means you believe the access is still needed and appropriate. Clicking **Deny** will halt the revocation process and close the task. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Repeat the process

Repeat these steps to review and take action on each task assigned to you. 

To take the same action on multiple tasks at once, select each task by clicking its checkbox, then select the action from the menu at the bottom left. You'll be prompted to add a comment about your action, which is posted on each impacted task. 

Click **Completed tasks** to see everything you've finished so far.

## Complete a deprovisioning task

A revocation proposal (see above) has already been reviewed and approved. A deprovisioning task is now assigned to you because manual deprovisioning of the revoked access is required and you are a designated manual deprovisioner for the app.

### Step 1: Receive a notification and go to the task

ConductorOne sends you notifications by email and Slack (if enabled) whenever a deprovisioning task is assigned to you. Make sure that notification emails can reach your inbox by adding [no-reply@conductorone.com](mailto:no-reply@conductorone.com) to your email contacts list.

<Tip>
Go to [Interact with ConductorOne via Slack](/product/admin/slack-application) for instructions on setting up our Slack app.
</Tip>

   - The **Execution plan** tab shows the task's workflow, highlighting the role you play, and the policy being applied to this task. 
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Repeat the process

Repeat these steps to complete each deprovisioning task assigned to you. 

Click **Completed tasks** to see everything you've finished so far.

## Reassign a task

If you need to reassign a task: 

<Steps>
<Step>
In the task list or the details view, click the **...** (more actions) menu and select **Reassign to...**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the new assignee and provide a reason for the reassignment.

Depending on how the request policy governing task is set up, you might have a limited number of approved users who the task can be reassigned to. 
</Step>
</Steps>
The newly assigned reviewer will receive email and Slack (if enabled) notifications about their new task assignment.

## Additional task actions 

Depending on your user permissions in ConductorOne, the task type, and the current status of the task, you might have additional task actions available to you in the **...** (more actions) menu. 

Actions labeled with a  <Icon icon="lock-keyhole" /> symbol are only available to users who have the **Super Administrator** role.
