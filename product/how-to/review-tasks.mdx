## Complete your reviews 

Your organization uses ConductorOne to run user access review (UAR) campaigns. You'll be assigned reviews in ConductorOne to verify that current access is still appropriate and needed. 

You might be asked to review:

- Your own access
- The access of people you manage
- Your colleagues' access to an application you own

### Step 1: Receive a notification

ConductorOne sends notifications by email and in the [Slack app](/product/admin/slack-application) (if enabled) when reviews are assigned to you. 

<Tip>
**Make sure that notification emails reach you:** 

Add [no-reply@conductorone.com](mailto:no-reply@conductorone.com) to your email contacts list.
</Tip>

Go directly to your reviews by clicking the link in your email or Slack notification. Or log into ConductorOne and click **Access reviews**, then select the campaign. 

### Step 2: Select how to view your reviews

There are three options, and you can switch between them at any time:

- **By application:** review access to each application in a separate review list.

- **By user:** review each user’s access in a guided format.

- **Unstructured:** all your assigned reviews together in one list. 

The campaign administrators may have selected a default view for you, but if you want to see your reviews organized differently, click **Change** at the top of the page to select a different view. 

### Step 3: Review the access and provide your decision

<Tip>
**Before you begin your reviews:** 

If the campaign administrators have provided any instructions for these access review tasks, you'll find them at the top of the page.
</Tip>

For each task:

1. **Review the access**

   - Look at the account and the resource. Is this access needed for the user’s work and appropriate to the user’s role in the company?

1. **Find more information and key insights** 

   - Click the task's row to open the details drawer, where you can view more information about the access to help you make your decision. The **Insights** section gives details such as how many other users in the organization have this access, the risk level of the access, and more.

2. **Provide your decision**

   - Click **Certify** to indicate that this access is needed and appropriate.

   - Click **Deny** to indicate that the access isn’t needed or isn’t appropriate, and that you’re recommending its removal.

<Tip>
   **I see there is more than one reviewer step. If I deny the access does it still go on to other reviewers?** 
   
   No, the review will stop at you, and the task will be closed.

   **Will denied access be removed immediately?**
   
   Maybe. Depending on the revocation policy governing the resource, the revocation might require a second [review and approval](/product/how-to/access-change-tasks#complete-a-revocation-task) before the access is removed.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Repeat the process

Repeat these steps to review and take action on each review assigned to you. 

To take the same action on multiple tasks at once, select your target tasks by clicking each task's checkbox, then select the action from the menu at the bottom left. You'll have the chance to add a comment about your action, which is posted on each impacted task. 

## Copilot's review recommendations and insights

ConductorOne Access Copilot provides insights and recommendations to help you complete your reviews. 

In the list view and in a task's details view, you'll see an **Insights** flag drawing your attention to important information about the access under review.

</Frame>

Copilot makes two kinds of recommendations about individual reviews: 

- Take a closer look
- Remove this access

If Copilot suggests taking a closer look at the access, you'll see an explanation of why a closer look is advised in the details view.

</Frame>

If Copilot recommends removing the access, you'll see the Copilot logo on the **Deny** button, and an explanation of the recommendation when you hover over the button, as well as in the details view.

## Additional task actions 

Depending on your user permissions in ConductorOne and the current status of the review task, you might have additional task actions available to you in the **...** (more actions) menu.
