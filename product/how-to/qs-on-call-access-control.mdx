## Before you begin

To complete this guide, you'll need:

- ConductorOne **Super Administrator** role
- A PagerDuty, OpsGenie, or other on-call-enabled application

**Estimated time:** 15 minutes

## Step 1: Integrate your on-call platform

Start by following the docs to integrate your on-call platform with ConductorOne:

<CardGroup>
<Card title="PagerDuty" icon="arrow-right" href="/baton/pagerduty"  horizontal />
<Card title="OpsGenie" icon="arrow-right" href="/baton/opsgenie"  horizontal />
</CardGroup>
<Tip>
**Don't see your on-call platform?**

Don't stress. We'll build a connector for it. [Get in touch](mailto:support@conductorone.com) and tell us what you need.
</Tip>

Once connected, ConductorOne ingests the users and roles within the platform, and surfaces on-call rotations as resources.

## Step 2: Create your on-call access profile

The on-call access profiles should include any apps, roles, permissions, or resources that are requestable by, or automatically granted to, a user who is on-call. 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Access profiles** and click **New profile**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Give the acces profile a name, such as "On-call". 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Continue**. 

   Now we'll add the entitlements that are either available for the user to request or automatically granted to the user. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Manage entitlements**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Use filters and the search field to locate the apps and entitlements that should be granted to the user, or available for them to request, when they are on-call. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Grant the access

You have two options here:  

- Make the entitlements in the access profiles requestable by users who are on-call
- Automatically grant the entitlements in the access profiles to users who are on-call

If **self-service requestable when on-call**:

<Steps>
<Step>
Click **Edit** on the **Self-service** section of the page.
</Step>
<Step>
Enable **Allow self-service**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Under **Requestable by**, select **Specific groups**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the on-call rotation or rotations that this access profile will be requestable by. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

If **automatically granted when on-call**:

<Steps>
<Step>
Click the **Enrollment** tab. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Edit** on the **Access requests** section of the page. 
</Step>
<Step>
Use the **Request policy** dropdown to select **Auto approve**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Edit** on the **Auto-enrollment rule** section of the page. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the on-call rotation or rotations that this access profiles will be automatically assigned to. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Important:** 

Automated enrollment with auto-granted access will automatically grant and provision all the entitlements in the access profiles to users who meet the criteria. 
</Warning>

## Success!

Now whenever a user is on-call, they will either automatically have access to request the on-call access profiles entitlements or have those entitlements automatically provisioned, depending on the configuration you set up.
