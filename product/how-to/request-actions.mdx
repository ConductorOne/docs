## What are actions?

Actions are on-demand workflows that you can request through ConductorOne. Unlike regular access requests, they're designed for operations that go beyond normal access requests, such as:

- Requesting a new laptop or other device
- Creating or modifying resources (for example, AD groups, GitHub repos)
- Executing operational workflows (for example, timecard punch-ins)
- Running just-in-time privileged tasks

Each action is governed by an approval policy and may require you to fill out a form with specific details about your request.

## Where can I find actions?

You can find and request actions in two places:

1. **Actions catalog**: Navigate to **Browse** > **Actions** to see all the actions available to you.

2. **Request access page**: Click **+ Request access** at the top of the page and select the **Actions** tab.

<Tip>
You'll only see actions that you have permission to request. If you don't see an action you need, contact your IT administrator.
</Tip>

## Request an action

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Browse** > **Actions** or click **+ Request access** and select the **Actions** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Browse or search for the action you need and click on it.
</Step>
<Step>
Fill out the request form. The form will ask for specific information needed to complete the action. Provide all required details.
</Step>
<Step>
Review your request details and click **Submit request**.

A drawer pops open to show you the details of the newly created action task.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your action request is submitted and will be routed for approval if required. You can always refer to this task later on the **My requests** list on the **Requests** page.

## What happens after I submit?

After you submit an action request:

1. **Approval (if required)**: If the action requires approval, it will be routed to the appropriate approvers (for example, your manager, IT lead, or the app owner). You'll receive a notification when your request is approved or denied.

2. **Execution**: Once approved (or if auto-approved), the action runs automatically. ConductorOne executes the workflow steps using the information you provided in the form.

3. **Completion**: You'll receive a notification when the action is completed. You can view the full history of your request, including all approvals and execution details, on the **My requests** page.

## Can I request actions for others?

Most users can only request actions for themselves, but there are a few exceptions:

- **Managers** can request actions for the members of their team.

- ConductorOne users with the **Access Request Helpdesk**, **Access Request Admin**, or **Super Administrator** roles can request actions for any active user.

If you're a manager or have one of these user roles, you'll see an option to request actions for others when creating an action request.

<Tip>
**Do I have to approve the action I request for another user?** 

If you request an action for another person, your approval of that action is understood to be implicit. So if the policy governing the action would normally assign a task to you for your approval, ConductorOne will auto-approve the request on your behalf.
