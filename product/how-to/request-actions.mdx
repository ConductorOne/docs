Actions are on-demand workflows that you can request through ConductorOne. Unlike regular access requests, actions let you trigger specific operations like requesting a new device, creating a resource, or executing an operational workflow.

## What are actions?

Actions are requestable automations that run under policy control. They're designed for operations that go beyond normal access requests, such as:

- Requesting a new laptop or other device
- Creating or modifying resources (for example, AD groups, GitHub repos)
- Executing operational workflows (for example, timecard punch-ins)
- Running just-in-time privileged tasks

Each action is governed by an approval policy and may require you to fill out a form with specific details about your request.

## Where can I find actions?

You can find and request actions in two places:

1. **Actions catalog**: Navigate to **Access** > **Browse** > **Actions** to see all the actions available to you.

2. **Request access page**: Click **+ Request access** at the top of the page and select the **Actions** tab.

<Tip>
You'll only see actions that you have permission to request. If you don't see an action you need, contact your IT administrator.
</Tip>

## Request an action

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Access** > **Browse** > **Actions** or click **+ Request access** and select the **Actions** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Browse or search for the action you need and click on it.
</Step>
<Step>
Fill out the request form. The form will ask for specific information needed to complete the action, such as:

- Device type or model
- Resource name or details
- Justification for the request
- Any other parameters specific to the action
</Step>
<Step>
Review your request details and click **Submit request**.

A drawer pops open to show you the details of the newly created request task.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your request is submitted and will be routed for approval if required. You can always refer to this task later on the **My requests** list on the **Requests** page.

## What happens after I submit?

After you submit an action request:

1. **Approval (if required)**: If the action requires approval, it will be routed to the appropriate approvers (for example, your manager, IT lead, or app owner). You'll receive a notification when your request is approved or denied.

2. **Execution**: Once approved (or if auto-approved), the action runs automatically. ConductorOne executes the workflow steps using the information you provided in the form.

3. **Completion**: You'll receive a notification when the action is completed. You can view the full history of your request, including all approvals and execution details, on the **My requests** page.

## Track your action requests

To see the status of your action requests:

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Requests** > **My requests**.
</Step>
<Step>
Find your action request in the list. You can:

- View the current status (pending approval, approved, in progress, completed, or denied)
- See who the assigned approvers are
- Leave a comment on the request
- Cancel the request if needed (while it's still pending)
</Step>
</Steps>

## Can I request actions for others?

Most users can only request actions for themselves, but there are a few exceptions:

- **Managers** can request actions for the members of their team.

- ConductorOne users with the **Access Request Helpdesk**, **Access Request Admin**, or **Super Administrator** roles can request actions for any active user.

If you're a manager or have one of these user roles, you'll see an option to request actions for others when creating an action request.

<Tip>
**Do I have to approve the action I request for another user?** 

If you request an action for another person, your approval of that action is understood to be implicit. So if the policy governing the action would normally assign a task to you for your approval, ConductorOne will auto-approve the request on your behalf.
</Tip>

## Common action examples

Here are some common types of actions you might see in your organization:

- **Device requests**: Request a new laptop, monitor, dock, or other equipment
- **Resource creation**: Create a new AD group, GitHub repository, or project space
- **Operational workflows**: Log timecard punch-ins, request environment access, or trigger operational toggles
- **Just-in-time access**: Request temporary elevated privileges for specific tasks

The specific actions available to you depend on what your IT administrators have configured for your organization.
