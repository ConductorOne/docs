## Where can I request new access?

You've got some choices! 

1. Do you want to explore all the access available to you? **Use the [Requests page](/product/how-to/create-requests#request-from-the-requests-page).** 

2. Do you know what you need and want to request it quickly? **Use the [Request access page](/product/how-to/create-requests#request-on-the-request-access-page).** 

3. Do you want to make a request without leaving your Slack or Microsoft Teams workspace? **Use [Slack](/product/how-to/create-requests#request-using-the-slack-app) or [MS Teams](/product/how-to/create-requests#request-using-the-microsoft-teams-app).** 

4. Do you prefer to request access from the command line? **Use the [ConductorOne CLI](/product/cli/install).**

## Why don't I see all the apps my company uses?

For both simplicity and security, the list of apps and permissions you can request is limited. If you're in the Accounting department, you probably don't need access to the tools the Product Design team uses, or vice versa. 

The ConductorOne admins at your company set up groups of apps and permissions called _access profiles_. Some access profiles are visible to everyone, but others are just for certain departments or job types. The access profiles you have access to determine which apps you can see and ask for.  

The admins also have the option to let you ask for **all** the apps in an access profile in a single request. If these are available to you, you'll find them on the **Profiles** tab.

## Can I request access for others?

Most users can only request their own access, but there are a few exceptions: 

* **Managers** can request access for the members of their team.

* ConductorOne users with the **Access Request Helpdesk**, **Access Request Admin**, or **Super Administrator** roles can request access for any active user.

If you're a manager or have one of these user roles, you'll see an option to request new access for others when creating an access request. Note that you cannot request access for a user who is suspended or deleted in ConductorOne. 

Review all the access you've requested for others, as well as any you've requested for yourself, by navigating to **Requests** > **My requests**.  

<Tip>
**Do I have to approve the access I request for another user?** 

If you request access for another person, your approval of that person receiving that access is understood to be implicit. So if the policy governing the requested access would normally assign an access request task to you for your approval, ConductorOne will auto-approve the request on your behalf. 
</Tip>

## Request from the Requests page

To browse the access that's assigned to you or available for you to request, go to the **Requests** page. 

### Request an app or permission

On the **Requests** page, you'll find a personalized **App catalog** tab containing all the apps and resources that are either currently assigned to you or available for you to request. 

<Frame>

</Frame>

A green checkmark on an app's tile indicates that you have access to that app. When you click on an app, a green checkmark on a resource indicates that you have access to that resource. 

To request new access:

<Steps>
<Step>
Click an app and select what you want to request: 

   * **Access to an application**: Click **Request**. 

      <Frame>
      <img src="/images/product/assets/browse-2.png" alt="An unassigned app showing the Request button."/>
      </Frame>

   * **A single permission**: Find the permission you need and click **Request**. 

      <Frame>
      <img src="/images/product/assets/browse-3.png" alt="The app catalog tab page showing available entitlements with one entitlement selected."/>
      </Frame>

   * **Multiple permissions**: Use the checkboxes to build the list of permissions you're requesting, then click **Request entitlements** at the bottom of the screen.

      </Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Set how long you need the access for. Some sensitive or expensive resources can only be requested for a limited time. Choose from one of the pre-set options, or enter a custom timeframe by selecting **Custom**. 

   When you're granted access for a limited time, ConductorOne will send you a reminder that the access is expiring three business days before the grant ends. (If the access is granted for three days or less, you won't get this reminder.) Expiring access is also shown in [digest emails](/product/admin/notifications).    

</Step>
<Step>
Tell the reviewer why you're requesting this access. This helps them make their decision, so be specific.
</Step>
<Step>
**If the emergency access toggle is present:** The access you're requesting is available for emergency access requests. If you're requesting this access to address an emergency (as defined by your company's critical incident or emergency procedures), click to turn on **Emergency access**.

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Submit request**. A drawer pops open to shown you the details of the newly created request task. 

   You can always refer to this task later on the **My requests** list on the **Requests** page. You can view the status of the request, leave a comment, and even cancel it if needed.  
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** ConductorOne will send you an email when your request is approved or rejected, and another when the new access is granted.

   <Frame>
   <img src="/images/product/assets/browse-5.png" alt="The Access profiles tab showing six available profiles."/>
   </Frame>

</Step>
<Step>
Set how long you need the access for. Some sensitive or expensive access profiles can only be requested for a limited time. Choose from one of the pre-set options, or enter a custom timeframe by selecting **Custom**. 

   When you're granted access for a limited time, ConductorOne will send you a reminder that the access is expiring three business days before the grant ends. (If the access is granted for three days or less, you won't get this reminder.) Expiring access is also shown in [digest emails](/product/admin/notifications). 
   
</Step>
<Step>
Tell the reviewer why you're requesting this profile. This helps them make their decision, so be specific.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Enroll**. 

</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** The request is created and added to your **My requests** list on the **Requests** page. 

While a request is pending, a link to the request task is shown. Click the link to view the status of the request and see who the assigned reviewers are. You can leave a comment on any request, and even cancel it if needed. 

ConductorOne will send you an email when your request is approved or rejected, and another when the new access is granted.

## Request on the Request access page

If you already know what access you need, use the **Request access** page to quickly submit a request. 

### Request a profile

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, at the top of the page, click **+ Request access** and select the **Access profiles** tab.

</Step>
<Step>
Select the profile you want to request. 

</Step>
<Step>
Set how long you need the access for. Some sensitive or expensive profiles can only be requested for a limited time. Choose from one of the pre-set options, or enter a custom timeframe by selecting **Custom**. 

   When you're granted access for a limited time, ConductorOne will send you a reminder that the access is expiring three business days before the grant ends. (If the access is granted for three days or less, you won't get this reminder.) Expiring access is also shown in [digest emails](/product/admin/notifications). 
</Step>
<Step>
Tell the reviewer why you're requesting this profile. This helps them make their decision, so be specific.

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Request profile**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** ConductorOne will automatically create individual requests for everything in the access profile that you don't already have access to. You can view the status of the requests on your **My requests** list on the **Requests** page. You can leave a comment on any request, and even cancel it if needed. 

ConductorOne will send you an email when your requests are approved or rejected, and another when new access is granted.

### Request an app or permission

<Steps>
<Step>
In ConductorOne, at the top of the page, click **+ Request access** and select the **Apps** tab.

</Step>
<Step>
Select an application from the **Which app?** dropdown, which shows all the apps that are available for you to request.

</Step>
<Step>
Select the specific entitlements you need. Based on the type of access available to you, your options might include:

   - **Basic app access**: Choose this option if you're looking for a new account on an app you're using for the first time.
      
   - **All entitlements**: Select from this list if you have an account on the app but need access to something more specialized. You can select more than one resource from the same application. 
   
   Any access you already have will be disabled in the list, and you'll see icons indicating open requests or access that's expiring soon. 

      <Frame>
      <img src="/images/product/assets/request-access-context.png" alt="The request access page showing the basic app access and all entitlements options."/>
      </Frame>

   <Tip>
   **Wait, my request page looks different.** 
   
   Don't worry. If your request page has fewer options, it means that because of your current access grants or the available resources on the app you've chosen, we can streamline the options for you and get you on your way.
   </Tip>
</Step>
<Step>
Set how long you need the access for. Some sensitive or expensive resources can only be requested for a limited time. Choose from one of the pre-set options, or enter a custom timeframe by selecting **Custom**. 

   When you're granted access for a limited time, ConductorOne will send you a reminder that the access is expiring three business days before the grant ends. (If the access is granted for three days or less, you won't get this reminder.) Expiring access is also shown in [digest emails](/product/admin/notifications). 

</Step>
<Step>
Tell the reviewer why you're requesting this access. This helps them make their decision, so be specific.

</Step>
<Step>
**If the emergency access toggle is present:** The access you're requesting is available for emergency access requests. If you're requesting this access to address an emergency (as defined by your company's critical incident or emergency procedures), click to turn on **Emergency access**.

   Emergency access requests bypass the normal review procedure and use a special expedited process to grant requests to critical access in emergency situations. Your company's IT procedures will define when it's appropriate to request emergency access.

   <Tip>
   **Can I escalate an open access request to emergency access?** 
   
   You can! If you requested standard non-emergency access, but realize you need emergency access while the request is still open, go to the request and click **Escalate to emergency access**.
   </Tip>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Submit request**. A drawer pops open to shown you the details of the newly created request task. 

   You can always refer to this task later on the **My requests** list on the **Requests** page. You can view the status of the request, leave a comment, and even cancel it if needed. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** ConductorOne will send you an email when your request is approved or rejected, and another when the new access is granted.

## Request using the Slack app

If your company uses Slack and an admin has set up the ConductorOne Slack app, you can request new access and receive notifications directly from the platform.

### Add the ConductorOne Slack app to your account

<Tip>
**Before you begin:** 

A Slack administrator at your company must install the ConductorOne app in your Slack workspace. 
</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step>
In Slack, navigate to the **Apps** section of the navigation bar.

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Add apps** and search for ConductorOne.

</Step>
<Step>
Click the ConductorOne app and follow the prompts to add it to your Slack account.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** You can now interact with ConductorOne directly from Slack.

### Create an access request

<Steps>
<Step>
In any Slack channel, type `/c1 request`.

   Alternatively, navigate to the ConductorOne Slack app and click **Home** > **Request Access**.

   The **Submit a Request** form opens. 

   <Frame>
   <img src="/images/product/assets/slack-1.png" alt="The Slack app showing the Submit a Request form."/>
   </Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Select an application from the **Which app do you need?** dropdown, which shows all the apps that are available for you to request.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the specific entitlement (permission) you need. If you're looking for a new account on an app you're using for the first time, choose **Access**.
</Step>
<Step>
If asked, specify how long you need the access for. Some sensitive or expensive resources have limited duration requirements, others can be requested indefinitely (if you're requesting one of these, you won't be asked about a duration).

   When you're granted access for a limited time, ConductorOne will send you a reminder that the access is expiring three business days before the grant ends. (If the access is granted for three days or less, you won't get this reminder.) Expiring access is also shown in [digest emails](/product/admin/notifications). 

</Step>
<Step>
Tell the reviewer why you're requesting this access. This helps them make their decision, and becomes a note in the audit log of all the access granted to all the company's employees.
</Step>

<Step>
Click **Submit**.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** You'll immediately get a new access request notification on the **Messages** tab of the Slack app.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/assets/slack-2.png" alt="The Slack app showing the Request access form with the Submit button."/>
</Frame>

This is also where you'll be notified when your new access is granted. Comments or updates on your request will be added to it in a thread. You can also type new comments in the thread, and they will be automatically copied to the request's details view in the ConductorOne web app and sent to the request's assigned approvers is Slack.   

If you want to see the access request task with all its details, click the blue **Grant [your name] [your requested access]** link in the notification to go to the request's details view in the ConductorOne web app.

## Request using the Microsoft Teams app

If your company uses Microsoft Teams and an admin has set up the ConductorOne Slack app, you can request new access and receive notifications directly from the platform.

### Set up the ConductorOne MS Teams app on an individual workstation

If a Teams admin at your organization has not automatically added the ConductorOne app to your organization's Teams interface, you can set it up on your workstation yourself. Here's what to do: 

<Steps>
<Step>
Go to [Microsoft Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/), search for "ConductorOne" and download the app. 

   If the app isn't available, check with an admin to ensure that they've completed the installation steps above.  

   If the app is available but you receive an error asking you to contact an admin, ensure they've completed the configuration process above. 
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** You're set up and ready to work with ConductorOne from the comfort of your Teams interface.

<Step>
Select the specific entitlement (permission) you need. If you're looking for a new account on an app you're using for the first time, choose **Access**.
</Step>
<Step>
If asked, specify how long you need the access for. Some sensitive or expensive resources have limited duration requirements, others can be requested indefinitely (if you're requesting one of these, you won't be asked about a duration).

   When you're granted access for a limited time, ConductorOne will send you a reminder that the access is expiring three business days before the grant ends. (If the access is granted for three days or less, you won't get this reminder.) Expiring access is also shown in [digest emails](/product/admin/notifications). 

</Step>
<Step>
Tell the reviewer why you're requesting this access. This helps them make their decision, and becomes a note in the audit log of all the access granted to all the company's employees.

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Submit**.
</Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** You'll get a new access request notification, and you'll receive updates in Teams about your request.
