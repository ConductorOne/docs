In this guide we'll set up self-service access requests for the **Connector Administrator** role in ConductorOne. Once setup is complete, users can request this role, either permanently or temporarily through JIT (just-in-time) access. 

## Before you begin

To complete this guide, you'll need:

- ConductorOne **Super Administrator** role

**Estimated time:** 5 minutes

## Step 1: Navigate to the ConductorOne app

First, we need to find the ConductorOne application:

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the **Applications** page.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the **ConductorOne** application on the **Managed apps** tab.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Publish the role for request

Next, make the **Connector Administrator** role requestable:
<Steps>
<Step>
Click **Entitlements**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click the **Role** filter to show only roles in ConductorOne. 
</Step>
<Step>
Locate the **Connector Administrator > assignment** entitlement. 

   We're going to configure this entitlement for self-service access requests using ConductorOne access controls. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Set controls** in the **Access controls** column for the entitlement. The access controls configuration drawer opens. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Access profiles** drop down, select **Everyone**. No need to set the other controls in the drawer right now. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Save**
</Step>
</Steps>
We have now published the **Connector Administrator** role to the **Everyone** access profile in ConductorOne. Now any ConductorOne user can request it. 

## Step 3: Test it out

Let's walk through the experience of a ConductorOne end user requesting the **Connector Administrator** role. We'll pretend that the requesting user (that's you!) temporarily needs the **Connector Administrator** role in order to create a new connector. 

<Steps>
<Step>
At the top of the page, click **+ Request access**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Who needs this access?** field, your name is pre-populated. Leave this as-is. 

   Managers and users with the Super Administrator role have the option to request access for other users. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Which app?** field, select **ConductorOne**. 
</Step>
<Step>

In the **Which resource?** field, select **Connector Admin > assignment**. 
</Step>
<Step>

In the **How long is access needed for?** field, select **1 hour**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the reason why you're requesting the access, such as "Getting started guide test". 

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Submit request**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

Your request is submitted and a summary is shown. Click **View request** to see the request task automatically created by ConductorOne. 

## Success!

Because of the default settings for this tenant, the access request will be automatically approved and provisioned. You have been granted the **Connector Administrator** role for one hour. 

Of course, this is a very simple example to illustrate the power of the ConductorOne platform. From here, we can add additional applications, enforce access controls on other entitlements and resources, update the approval policies, and much, much, more!
