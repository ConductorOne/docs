## Before you begin

To complete this guide, you'll need:

- ConductorOne **Connector Administrator** role or **Super Administrator** role
- A Google Cloud Platform account
- Ability to set up a service account in GCP

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

## Step 1: Integrate your GCP instance

Start by integrating your GCP instance with ConductorOne by following the instructions in [Google Workspace & Google Cloud Platform](/baton/gcp-gws).

Once connected, ConductorOne ingests all of the projects, resources, and entitlements for Google Cloud. This includes projects and roles. You can see all the resources and entitlements by navigating to **Applications** > **Google Cloud Platform** and clicking the **Entitlements** tab.

## Step 2: Configure GCP projects for JIT access

Now that GCP is hooked up to ConductorOne, set GCP projects and roles as available for just-in-time access. To do this, we'll configure access controls for each of the GCP projects. 

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the **Applications** page, then click the **Google Cloud** application created in Step 1.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Setup** tab, in the **Entitlement configuration rules** section of the page, click **Edit**. 
</Step>
<Step>

In the configuration rules pane, click the toggle to **Enable configuration rules**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the **Project** resource type. 
</Step>
<Step>
Use the **Access profiles** dropdown to select **Everyone**.  
</Step>
<Step>
Finally, check the box at the bottom of the screen and click **Apply**.
</Step>
</Steps>
The new settings are applied, and a summary of the configuration is shown in the **Entitlement configuration rules** section of the page. 

<Tip>
**Don’t worry,** 

you can change who can request access, for how long, and the policy for approving access later. 
</Tip>

## Step 3: Request JIT access

Let's go request GCP JIT access!

<Steps>
<Step>
Click **Requests** and make sure that **App catalog** is selected. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Google Cloud Platform**. A panel opens with the projects available for you to request.  
</Step>
<Step>
Click on the project you want to request, then click **Request**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the justification and click **Request**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Success!

The request policy routes the request through the approval process. The new access will be automatically provisioned by the GCP connector, and then automatically removed upon expiration.
