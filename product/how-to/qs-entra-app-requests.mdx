## Before you begin

To complete this guide, you'll need:

- ConductorOne **Super Administrator** or **Connector Administrator** role
- A Microsoft Entra account

**Estimated time:** 10 minutes

## Step 1: Integrate your Microsoft Entra instance

Start by integrating your Microsoft Entra instance with ConductorOne. Use the [Microsoft Entra connector](/baton/microsoft-entra) to sync Microsoft Entra to ConductorOne.

Once connected, ConductorOne ingests all of the users, apps, groups, and other entitlements and resources from Microsoft Entra. 

## Step 2: Convert a Microsoft Entra app to a managed app

Before managing access to an Microsoft Entra app, you'll need to begin managing it with ConductorOne.

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to **Applications** and click the **Unmanaged apps** tab. 
</Step>
<Step>
Find the application you want to enable for self-service or lifecycle management. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Manage**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Don’t stress.** 

Converting an app from unmanaged to managed in ConductorOne does not change any configuration in the IdP. 
</Tip>

Once an application is managed, you can enforce access controls, run user access reviews, and drive lifecycle management for the app.

## Step 3: Configure the app entitlements (optional)

Every managed application in ConductorOne comes with a **Credential** resource. This "access entitlement" is used to manage account-level access to application. In Microsoft Entra, at a minimum, this means that the user is assigned to the Microsoft Entra app. 

Additionally, applications configured in Microsoft Entra may use groups to SCIM roles and permissions to the connected application. ConductorOne can easily convert these **linked entitlements** into resources and entitlements in your ConductorOne instance. 

If groups are assigned to the application in Microsoft Entra, you can convert these linked entitlements from Microsoft Entra into in-app entitlements in the ConductorOne app:

<Steps>
<Step>
On the app's **Entitlements** tab, click the **Linked entitlements** icon at the top right corner of the entitlements table (the icon looks like a Venn diagram).
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Linked entitlements** drawer, click the **Setup** tab. 
</Step>
<Step>
For each IdP entitlement ConductorOne has identified as linked to the app, choose an action: 

   - **Create virtual role**: Set up a new role in the app that will be linked to the IdP entitlement. This role will only exist in ConductorOne, and will function as an alias for the IdP entitlement. Your colleagues can request and review the role, which will appear as part of the app, but they will in actuality be requesting or reviewing the IdP entitlement. 

   - **Provision access for**: Link the IdP entitlement to an existing entitlement in the app. When your colleagues request or review the app entitlement, they will also be requesting or reviewing the IdP entitlement. 

   - **Skip**: Do nothing.
</Step>
<Step>
When you've made all of your selections, click **Save**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

ConductorOne will now create the resources and entitlements in the managed app, and importantly, will set a binding for that entitlement to the Microsoft Entra group (we'll get to bindings later). For now, just know that this allows us to perform magic!

## Step 4: Configure the app and entitlements for self-service

Now we'll configure the application and any entitlements we created in Step 3 so they're ready for self-service requests.  

<Steps>
<Step>
Navigate to the app's **Setup** tab
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Entitlement configuration rules** section of the page, click **Edit**. 
</Step>
<Step>
In the configuration rules pane, click the toggle to **Enable configuration rules**.
</Step>
<Step>
If you want to make the app itself requestable, click **Credential** in the selected resources. 
</Step>
<Step>
If you want to make the roles or other entitlements you created in Step 3 requestable, select those resource types. 
</Step>
<Step>
Use the **Access profiles** dropdown to select **Everyone**.  
</Step>
<Step>
Finally, check the box at the bottom of the screen and click **Apply**.
</Step>
</Steps>
## Step 5: Request your Microsoft Entra app and roles

Now we're ready it give it a whirl!

<Steps>
<Step>
Click **Requests** and make sure that **App catalog** is selected. 
</Step>
<Step>
Find the application you just created. 

   If you've made the application requestable, you'll see a **Request** button on the app. If you've made individual roles or entitlements requestable, you'll see those on the app. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the app or a role you want to request, and click **Request**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the justification and click **Request**. 
</Step>
</Steps>
## Success!

The request will be auto-approved based on the policy, and you will be provisioned access by assigning you to the application and the correct groups in Microsoft Entra!
