In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to run an access review ... of ConductorOne! You don't need to have any applications connected to ConductorOne for this demo. We'll run a review of everyone with the **Super Administrator** role in ConductorOne.

## Before you begin

To complete this guide, you'll need:

- ConductorOne **Super Administrator** or **Campaign Administrator** role

**Estimated time:** 10 minutes

## Step 1: Create a campaign

First, we'll set up the campaign we'll use to run our access reviews.

<Steps> 
<Step>
Navigate to **Admin** > **Campaigns**. 
</Step>

<Step>
Click **New campaign** and fill out the form as follows: 


   - **Campaign name**: "C1 Super Admin UAR"
   - **Description**: Leave this blank
   - **Campaign type**: Single instance
   - **Target completion date**: Use the auto-selected date
   - **Owner**: Use the auto-selected user, that's you!
   - **Review policy**: Choose **App owner certification**
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Continue**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Scope the campaign

We now need to set the scope of the campaign. We're going to scope this campaign to reviewing anyone who has **Super Administrator** access to the ConductorOne console.

<Steps>
<Step>
On the **Scope** tab of the campaign, find the **Apps and resources** section of the page and click **Make selections**. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Review specific resources**.
</Step>
<Step>
Search for the term "super" and find the **Super Administrator** role listed for the ConductorOne application. 
</Step>
<Step>
Select the **Super Administrator** role and click **Save**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Prepare & start the campaign

Before a campaign can be started, it must be prepared. Preparing a campaign takes a snapshot of current grants and populates the campaign with the corresponding access reviews.

<Steps>
<Step>
Click **Prepare campaign**. When prompted by the pop-up, click **Prepare**. 

   We now have our access reviews prepared for the campaign. Because we selected **App owner certification** as the policy for this campaign, when the campaign begins these reviews will be assigned to the application owner of the ConductorOne application. 
</Step>
<Step>
When you're ready, click **Start campaign** and decide whether to send out campaign notifications. 

   If you check **Yes, send out notifications** when starting the campaign, reviewers will be notified by email (and Slack, if enabled) that a new campaign is underway and they have reviews to complete. 
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Start campaign**. 
</Step>
</Steps>

Your campaign is underway! 

## Step 4: Manage the campaign

ConductorOne provides a deep bench of tools for managing the successful completion of user access reviews in a timely fashion. These include:

- Sending reminders
- Canceling reviews
- Reassigning reviews
- Restarting reviews
- Revoking or changing access if not certified

These tools are available from the campaign management screen.

## Step 5: End the campaign

Once the reviews are in, end the campaign. If any access reviews are incomplete when the campaign ends, you'll be asked what you want to do:

- **Skip**: these reviews will be skipped, meaning no decision was recorded
- **Revoke**: these reviews are marked with a revoke decision

## Step 6: Generate audit reports 

At any point during or after the campaign, generate an auditor-ready campaign report on the **Reports** tab.

## Success! 

By following these steps, you’ve completed a successful certification campaign using ConductorOne ... for ConductorOne!
