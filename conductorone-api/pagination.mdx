title: Pagination in the ConductorOne API
description: "When making `LIST` or `SEARCH` requests to the ConductorOne API, use the `page_size` and `page_token` parameters to navigate through the list of results."

## Using page\_size

Include the `page_size` parameter to tell the API how many search or list results to show on each page.

**`page_size` accepts a number between 10 and 100.**

- If you enter a number smaller than 10, the system will return 10 results per page.
- If you enter a number larger than 100, the system will return 100 results per page.
- The default value is 25.

## Using page\_token

If your query returns more results than will fit on one page of the size you specified with `page_size`, you'll see a unique `nextPageToken` value at the bottom of the response. Include this value with the `page_token` parameter in your next request to see the next page of results.

You do not need to include `page_token` in your initial request (or you can include it but leave it empty), but you must do so for each subsequent request.

Here's a simplified example of using `page_token` to navigate a list of results:

```bash First request

curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://example.conductor.one/api/v1/apps/sample/entitlements?page_size=50'
```

```json First response
{
  "list": [
    {
      "appEntitlement": {
        // List of 50 app entitlements with their details.
      }
  ],
  "nextPageToken": "samplepaggetoken1"
}
```


```bash Second request

curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://example.conductor.one/api/v1/apps/sample/entitlements?page_size=50&page_token=samplepagetoken1'
```

<Tip>
**Note:** For this `GET` example, the `page_size` and `page_token` are included in the query. For `POST` requests, `page_size` and `page_token` are included in the body instead.
</Tip>

```json Second response
"list": [
    {
      "appEntitlement": {
        // List of 50 more app entitlements with their details.
    }
  ],
  "nextPageToken": "samplepaggetoken2"
}
```
```bash Third request

curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://example.conductor.one/api/v1/apps/sample/entitlements?page_size=50&page_token=samplepagetoken2'
```
```json Third response
{
  "list": [
    {
      "appEntitlement": {
        // List of 26 more app entitlements with their details.
    }
  ],
  "nextPageToken": ""
  // An empty nextPageToken is printed in the third response because the user has reached the end of the list of results.
}
```
